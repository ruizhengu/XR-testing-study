abstract={This paper presents a new Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC) to model the Variable Reluctance Resolver (VR-Resolver) and study the effect of different windings configurations on its performance. Therefore, VR-Resolver with non-overlapping (constant turn) and overlapping (variable turn) windings are modeled to investigate their effect on the accuracy of obtained results. The proposed method gives the possibility to model both healthy and faulty conditions by a unique model to analyze faults effects on the position error. For this purpose, the inter-turn fault is considered on the excitation winding, and both dynamic and static eccentric rotors (DE and SE) are studied. It is shown that the variable turn VR-Resolver has more accuracy and lower sensitivity to eccentricity fault, while the constant turn type is less sensitive to inter-turn fault. However, the latter may be preferred in some applications thanks to its simpler windings and lower manufacturing costs. Finally, the MEC results are proved by Finite Element Method (FEM) and experimental results. Generally, the model flexibility and shorter processing time can be considered as the proposed MEC advantages over FEM.},

abstract={As one of the most promising smart materials, magnetorheological (MR) gels have been widely applied in the vibration mitigation of engineering structures. An accurate and effective model for MR gels is of great significance for its in-depth research and engineering application. Existing models for MR materials mainly follow the magnetic dipole theory used for MR fluid, but this theory takes no account of the particle size and, thus, cannot apply to MR gels with a relatively higher volume fraction of particles. In this paper, a micromechanical model for MR gels was proposed and experimentally verified based on the planar current loop model. Firstly, high-performance MR gels were prepared, and basic performance characterizations, including the magnetization property and the sedimentation stability, were carried out. Then the magnetic energy of particles calculated by the magnetic dipole model and the planar current loop model were compared, and the micromechanical model of MR gels was proposed based on the planar current loop model. In the parameter determination process, the data obtained by magnetization tests of the particles were fitted to form the magnetization curve with higher accuracy. Finally, the yield shear stresses of the prepared MR gels were obtained by property tests, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed micromechanical model were verified by comparing the test data with the theoretical values calculated by the proposed model.},

abstract={This paper investigates the usability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) methods, traditional PPP with a float-ambiguity solution and with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR), in structural health monitoring applications based on experimental tests using a single-axis shake table. To evaluate the performance of the PPP methodologies, harmonic oscillations of the motion table with amplitudes ranging from 5 to 10 mm and frequency between 0.1 and 3 Hz were generated representing a wide range of possible structural motions. In addition, ground motion similar to those experienced during a real earthquake, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and step motions were generated on the shake table. GNSS PPP–derived positioning results at 20 Hz were compared, in both of the frequency and time domains, with reference data comprising LVDT data and relative positioning data. Results show that both PPP methods’ measurements can be used in the computation of harmonic oscillation frequencies compared to the LVDT and relative positioning values. The observed amplitudes of the harmonic oscillations are slightly different from the LVDT values on the order of millimeters. The results of a step motion experiment demonstrated that PPP-AR is better than traditional PPP in exhibiting quasi-static or static displacement. Moreover, the capabilities of traditional PPP and PPP-AR methods are evaluated with respect to the natural frequency of a small-scale structural model excited on the shake table. The frequency spectrum of this small-scale structural model derived from the PPP methods is consistent with finite-element model (FEM)–predicted values and relative positioning. The research presented here demonstrates the potential of the high-rate GNSS PPP and PPP-AR methods to reliably monitor structural and earthquake-induced vibration frequencies and amplitudes for both structural and seismological applications. Specifically, all results reveal that high-rate PPP-AR is more accurate than traditional PPP for both dynamic and static displacement detection.},

abstract={Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is the gold standard for evaluating the presence of visual field defects (VFDs). Nevertheless, it has requirements such as prolonged attention, stable fixation, and a need for a motor response that limit application in various patient groups. Therefore, a novel approach using eye movements (EMs) - as a complementary technique to SAP - was developed and tested in clinical settings by our group. However, the original method uses a screen-based eye-tracker which still requires participants to keep their chin and head stable. Virtual reality (VR) has shown much promise in ophthalmic diagnostics - especially in terms of freedom of head movement and precise control over experimental settings, besides being portable. In this study, we set out to see if patients can be screened for VFDs based on their EM in a VR-based framework and if they are comparable to the screen-based eyetracker. Moreover, we wanted to know if this framework can provide an effective and enjoyable user experience (UX) compared to our previous approach and the conventional SAP. Therefore, we first modified our method and implemented it on a VR head-mounted device with built-in eye tracking. Subsequently, 15 controls naïve to SAP, 15 patients with a neuro-ophthalmological disorder, and 15 glaucoma patients performed three tasks in a counterbalanced manner: (1) a visual tracking task on the VR headset while their EM was recorded, (2) the preceding tracking task but on a conventional screen-based eye tracker, and (3) SAP. We then quantified the spatio-temporal properties (STP) of the EM of each group using a cross-correlogram analysis. Finally, we evaluated the human-computer interaction (HCI) aspects of the participants in the three methods using a user-experience questionnaire. We find that: (1) the VR framework can distinguish the participants according to their oculomotor characteristics; (2) the STP of the VR framework are similar to those from the screen-based eye tracker; and (3) participants from all the groups found the VR-screening test to be the most attractive. Thus, we conclude that the EM-based approach implemented in VR can be a user-friendly and portable companion to complement existing perimetric techniques in ophthalmic clinics.},

abstract={The Chinese medicine Qigesan can be used to treat esophageal adenocarcinoma in the Chinese mainland widely, but its mechanism is unclear. In order to investigate the mechanism of Qigesan in the treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma, the concept of network pharmacology was used in this study. The database named TCMSP was used to identify the active therapeutic components as well as targets of Qigesan. The TTD, OMIM, CTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards database were used to identify genes related to esophageal adenocarcinoma. In STRING database, the potential targets were imported to obtain a PPI network, and then Cytoscape software has been used to analyse the results. Subsequently, important components and targets were simulated by molecular docking. Finally, experiments on the cell have been done to verify well docking targets. A total of 124 effective compounds and 646 corresponding targets were filtered. 1478 genes were found to be related to esophageal adenocarcinoma. 68 genes were identified as potential targets for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the 68 potential targets indicated that the genes were mainly involved in cell transcription, translation, and apoptosis and mostly expressed in cancer-related pathways. The molecular docking analysis of the hub targets with their corresponding compounds indicated that the well docking targets were AR, ERBB2, and VEGFA. The cell experiments showed that Qigesan can reduce the expression of AR, ERBB2, and VEGFA at transcription and translation level. This network pharmacology study described that the possible targets of Qigesan in treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma were AR, ERBB2, and VEGFA.},

Porous silicon layers were fabricated and irradiated with beams of noble gases ions. The shift in a crystalline phase line in Raman spectra was used to estimate the size of nanocrystallites in the structure of porous silicon at different irradiation fluences. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were conducted to obtain the fluence dependence of the spin concentration in the porous structure after ion implantation. The concentration of paramagnetic defects (dangling bonds) in porous silicon was found to be monotonically dependent on ion irradiation fluence and reached the value of 1021 cm−3. A comparison of the defect formation rate in bulk and porous silicon is shown, the extreme spin concentration in porous silicon is estimated. The potential application of ion beam irradiations to enhance the efficiency of porous silicon-based contrasts agents in magnetic resonance imaging is discussed.},

abstract={The psychological effects of information technology (IT) use have been widely reported and assessed in the literature. However, although concerns are growing regarding the potential physiological impacts of IT use on the health of IT users, assessment of this issue is currently hampered by the lack of an appropriate information-system (IS) physiological scale. Given the limited utility of existing self-report instruments, the main purpose of this study is to develop an instrument to measure perceived physiological vulnerability to IT use (PPVITU). This study introduces and defines a PPVITU construct, validates this construct and its basic dimensions empirically, develops a generic PPVITU instrument with appropriate psychometric properties, and examines the theoretical and practical applications of this instrument. After analyzing data provided by 308 IT-user respondents, this study proposes a 4-factor, 17-item PPVITU instrument. The authors expect that this empirically validated instrument will be useful to researchers working to develop and test theories of educational technology use as well as to educators working to better understand student perceptions of physiological vulnerability to IT and educational-technology use.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEThe aim of this study is to assess whether distraction (lack of attentional focus) and attention (cognitive load) are differentially involved in the analgesic effect of virtual reality (VR) immersions during a cold pressor test (CPT).METHODSThirty-one participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (high and low cognitive load, attention with or without a reminder of the pain stimuli) and performed three CPTs. Pain was assessed based on the duration of the CPT (pain tolerance), a visual analog rating scale of perceived pain intensity during the CPT and the subjective pain scale of the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).RESULTSThe statistical analyses revealed that VR immersions were associated with less pain compared to the baseline (all p <0.001), but for the experimental manipulations, only the conditions where there was an increase in cognitive load (ie, from low cognitive load at Immersion 1 to high cognitive load at Immersion 2) were effective for increasing pain tolerance (significant Time X Conditions interaction). The interactions were not significant for pain intensity assessed with the VAS or the SF-MPQ.CONCLUSIONThe results suggest that increases in cognitive load play an important role in the analgesic effect of VR immersion, although the combination of attentional focus and cognitive load may be important. Suggestions are given for designing a replication study.},

abstract={In recent years, adaptations of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) have shown that socially evaluative stress can effectively elicit psychobiological responses in a standardized way in Virtual Reality (VR). While these methods hold many advantages, the underlying mechanisms of stress-induction effects via virtual avatars are still largely unclear. The present study tested whether the similarity of the real and virtual world modulates the stress response during a virtual TSST by intensifying the experience of presence. For this purpose, two groups performed the TSST-VR while their virtual surroundings were either a replication of the real laboratory or a foreign environment. Although a significant stress response with regard to salivary cortisol, salivary alpha amylase, heart rate and subjective feelings of stress was found in both groups, the parallelization of the real and virtual environment did not lead to an increase in physiological or subjective stress. Furthermore, both groups did not differ in self-reported presence. Beyond reproducing previous findings of successful psychobiological stress induction in VR, the results indicate that the paradigm is effective regardless of the context it is employed in and therefore could be a promising tool in multi-center research projects or clinical applications.},

abstract={This paper studies Bayesian inference on longitudinal mixed effects models with non-normal AR(1) errors. We model the nonparametric zero-mean noise in the autoregression residual with a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model. Applying the empirical likelihood tool, an adjusted sampler based on the Pólya urn representation of DP is proposed to incorporate information of the moment constraints of the mixing distribution. A Gibbs sampling algorithm based on the adjusted sampler is proposed to approximate the posterior distributions under DP priors. The proposed method can easily be extended to address other moment constraints owing to the wide application background of the empirical likelihood. Simulation studies are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Our method is illustrated via the analysis of a longitudinal dataset from a psychiatric study.},

abstract={Head motion occurring during brain PET studies leads to image blurring and to bias in measured local quantities. The objective of this work was to implement a correction method for PET data acquired with the mMR synchronous PET/MR scanner. Methods: A list-mode–based motion-correction approach has been designed. The developed rebinner chronologically reads the recorded events from the Siemens list-mode file, applies the estimated geometric transformations, and frames the detected counts into sinograms. The rigid-body motion parameters were estimated from an initial dynamic reconstruction of the PET data. We then optimized the correction for 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PIB) scans using simulated and actual data with well-controlled motion. Results: An efficient list-mode–based motion correction approach has been implemented, fully optimized, and validated using simulated and actual PET data. The average spatial resolution loss induced by inaccuracies in motion parameter estimates and by the rebinning process was estimated to correspond to a 1-mm increase in full width at half maximum with motion parameters estimated directly from the PET data with a temporal frequency of 20 s. The results show that the rebinner can be safely applied to the 11C-PIB scans, allowing almost complete removal of motion-induced artifacts. The application of the correction method to a large cohort of 11C-PIB scans led to the following observations: first, that more than 21% of the scans were affected by motion greater than 10 mm (39% for subjects with Mini–Mental State Examination scores below 20), and second, that the correction led to quantitative changes in Alzheimer-specific cortical regions of up to 30%. Conclusion: The rebinner allows accurate motion correction at a cost of minimal resolution reduction. Application of the correction to a large cohort of 11C-PIB scans confirmed the necessity of systematically correcting for motion to obtain quantitative results.},

We studied how immersive three-dimensional (3-D) virtual reality environments may augment and advance the evaluation of safety-critical nuclear power plant CR systems. A multiuser functionality enables several operators to be located and to collaborate in the same virtual CR environment at the same time. There is also a realistic representation of emergency operating procedures in the virtual CR. Spatial audio communication through headsets makes the experience even more realistic. The paper addresses both technical and human factors issues associated with the use of immersive 3-D virtual reality environments in CR validation tests, for example, the amount of technical resources required as compared to normal validation in a real-life physical simulator environment, creation of methodologically new testing opportunities, and new opportunities for data registration and analysis. A new framework has been established for estimating the needed fidelity level of the virtual CR for the type of system evaluation at hand.},

abstract={Objectives: The study objective was to validate a recently introduced non-invasive image derived input function (IDIF) estimation method with the gold standard arterial blood sampling. Methods: Six subjects (31-50 years old) were injected with 408±62 MBq of 15O-water simultaneously with the start of a 10 min PET scan on the SIGNA PET-MR (GE Healthcare, WI, Waukesha). During PET scanning, a sagittal vascular (inhance 3D velocity) MR series was used with the following parameters: TR=8.7 ms, TE=4.1 ms, FOV=24x21.6 cm, slice thickness=3 mm, 32 slices, velocity encoding=40, phase acceleration=2.0, and scan time=1:21 min. The PET list file was unlisted for every second and total true and scatter coincident events were plotted to identify tracer arrival into the brain arteries. Then, a short time frame over the arrival of the tracer to the cervical region was reconstructed to obtain a PET angiogram. The cervical arteries were then segmented using the MR vascular images and PETA images. Spill-over and spill- in artifacts were estimated using PETA images and the actual arterial volume was measured from the MR vascular images. The PET list file was unlisted and images were reconstructed for every 1 s for the first 30 s, every 3 s for the next 30 s, every 5 s for the 2nd minute, every 10 s for the 3rd and 4th minute and every 30 s for 5th to 10th minutes. The AIF was estimated by dividing total counts from the cervical arteries of each frame by the MR-based arterial volume. For each patient, blood samples were continuously drawn from the radial artery at the wrist using a peristaltic pump, and the tracer concentration in the arterial blood was measured using a Twilite two detector (Swisstrace) to estimate the AIF. In order to calculate the AIF at the brain arteries from these blood samples, the delay and dispersion of the arterial input function was corrected using standard PET-based methods. The CBF and distribution volume were calculated using both the IDIF method and the blood samples by minimizing the mean square of the error between the PET observations and model fit using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm in MATLAB (Mathworks, Wilmington, MA). Results: Figure 1 shows the (a) PETA and (b) MR vascular images for one of the patients. The PETA images clearly show the arteries and the extent of the spill-over. Figure 2 compares the AIF curve estimated by the proposed IDIF method and the AIF curve measured by the blood samples. The comparison shows excellent correspondence between the IDIF method and the gold standard blood sampling method with 9% and 11% difference for the 1st pass and the entire AIF, respectively. The IDIF captures the AIF peak correctly and has increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to the blood sampling method. The delay and the dispersion of the AIF curve is nearly identical between the two methods. The CBF over the whole brain was measured 29.5±8.7 and 27.0±14 ml/s/100g with the AIF measured by IDIF method and blood samples, respectively with a mean difference of 14% between the two methods. The volume distribution over the whole brain was measured 0.5±0.1 for both methods with a mean difference of 15% between them. Conclusion: As the results show, the proposed method is capable of determining a high fidelity IDIF from simultaneous PET/MRI data. Having a "blood-free" method that obviates the need for direct arterial sampling is of benefit to both investigators and their subjects, because of the high costs, inconvenience, and potential risks associated with arterial cannulation. It has applications beyond 15O-water PET, enabling pharmacokinetic modeling to be performed that is required for quantitative PET tracer studies.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDSeveral systemic treatment options are currently available for patients with metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer (mCRPC), including the androgen-receptor targeting agents (ARTA) enzalutamide and abiraterone, the taxanes docetaxel and cabazitaxel, and the radioisotope drug 223-radium dichloride. In some patients with mCRCP, alternative splicing of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA occurs, resulting in the formation of a truncated AR lacking the androgen-binding domain. These receptors activate downstream signalling pathways even without the ligand. Recent studies show that the presence of the AR-V7 (ARV - AR variants) splicing variant is associated with resistance to ARTA. Bec>ause the presence of AR-V7 does not affect the efficacy of other systemic therapies used in mCRCPs, particularly taxanes, AR-V7 is a candidate predictive biomarker for the individualisation of mCRCP treatment. Two types of assays based on mRNA or abnormal protein detection are used to detect AR-V7 in circulating tumour cells.AIMTo describe the current status of AR-V7 testing in mCRPC and possible applications of this method for predicting outcomes of ARTA therapy.CONCLUSIONThe percentage of CTC AR-V7+ in ARTA-naive men is relatively low at baseline, but in patients pretreated with ARTA, the prevalence of AR-V7 increases to 19-34%. Given the relatively high expected prevalence, AR-V7 testing may be economically feasible in this population. The proportion of AR-V7+ patients responding to ARTA retreatment appears to be very low, at only 4.8%. AR-V7 testing could thus be useful if an ARTA switch is considered in a patient progressing onto an ARTA drug. Both protein-based tests and mRNA-based tests are currently undergoing clinical validation in prospective studies, with results expected within a year.Key words: prostate cancer - abiraterone - enzalutamide - alternative splicing - drug resistanceSubmitted: 30. 8. 2017Accepted: 5. 11. 2017 doc.

abstract={The use of virtual reality (VR) for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. This reliability study included 46 asymptomatic participants, who were assessed using the neck VR system which displayed an interactive VR scenario via a head-mounted device, controlled by neck movements. The objective of the interactive assessment was to hit 16 targets, randomly appearing in four directions, as fast as possible. Each participant was tested twice by two different testers. Good reliability was found of neck motion kinematic measures in flexion, extension, and rotation (0.64-0.93 inter-class correlation). High reliability was shown for peak velocity globally (0.93), in left rotation (0.9), right rotation and extension (0.88), and flexion (0.86). Mean velocity had a good global reliability (0.84), except for left rotation directed movement with moderate reliability (0.68). Minimal detectable change for peak velocity ranged from 41 to 53 degree /s, while mean velocity ranged from 20 to 25 degree /s. The results suggest high reliability for peak and mean velocity as measured by the interactive Neck VR assessment of neck motion kinematics. VR appears to provide a reliable and more ecologically valid method of cervical motion evaluation than previous conventional methodologies.},

abstract={The feature identification method based on artificial intelligence can significantly improve accuracy and effectiveness of sensor fault diagnosis. An improved support vector machine (SVM)-K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification method that combines one-verse-rest (1-v-r) SVM and KNN was brought for sensor fault recognition. The method firstly constructs 1-v-r SVM training set by primary selection on training samples, and then classifies it using 1-v-r method. It re-classifies indivisible samples with KNN algorithm. Fault diagnosis experiment on photoelectric encoder sensor verifies that it can determine current fault belongs to which type of common sensor faults. The experiment also compared SVM-KNN with one-verse-one (1-v-1) SVM and bintree SVM. Results show that it has better classification accuracy and classification speed.},

abstract={The advent of neuroimaging in dental research provides exciting opportunities for relating excitation of trigeminal neurons to human somatosensory perceptions. Cold air sensitivity is one of the most frequent causes of dental discomfort or pain. Up to date, devices capable of delivering controlled cold air in an MR-environment are unavailable for quantitative sensory testing. This study therefore aimed at constructing and evaluating a novel MR-compatible, computer-controlled cold air stimulation apparatus (CASA) that produces graded air puffs. CASA consisted of a multi-injector air jet delivery system (AJS), a cold exchanger, a cooling agent, and a stimulus application construction. Its feasibility was tested by performing an fMRI stimulation experiment on a single subject experiencing dentine cold sensitivity. The novel device delivered repetitive, stable air stimuli ranging from room temperature (24.5°C ± 2°C) to -35°C, at flow rates between 5 and 17 liters per minute (l/min). These cold air puffs evoked perceptions similar to natural stimuli. Single-subject fMRI-analysis yielded brain activations typically associated with acute pain processing including thalamus, insular and cingulate cortices, somatosensory, cerebellar, and frontal brain regions. Thus, the novel CASA allowed for controlled, repetitive quantitative sensory testing by using air stimuli at graded temperatures (room temperature down to -35°C) while simultaneously recording brain responses. No MR-compatible stimulation device currently exists that is capable of providing non-contact natural-like stimuli at a wide temperature range to tissues in spatially restricted areas such as the mouth. The physical characteristics of this novel device thus holds promise for advancing the field of trigeminal and spinal somatosensory research, namely with respect to comparing therapeutic interventions for dentine hypersensitivity.},

abstract={Kinematic calibration is an effective and economical way to improve the accuracy of surgical robot, and in most cases, it is a necessary procedure before the robot is put into operation. This study investigates a novel kinematic calibration method where the effect of controller error is taken into account when formulating the model based on screw theory, which is applied to the kinematic control of magnetic resonance compatible surgical robot. Based on screw theory, the kinematic error model is established for the relationship between error of controller and the deviation of the measured pose of the end-effector. Therefore, the error of controller can be figured out and parameters of controller can be adjusted accordingly. Control strategy based on the kinematic calibration framework is proposed. According to artificial neural network, the deviation of end-effector in arbitrary configuration can be effectively obtained. Comparative experiments are carried out to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework with the help of commercial visual system and joint encoders.},

abstract={Introduction: MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) has attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians as a potential modality for cancer treatment over the last decades. Despite recent progress, the real application of MRgFUS still remains a challenge due to problems with the optimization of ultrasound parameters and standardization of clinical protocol. In this study, we utilized an ex vivo animal model in order to elucidate the effect of focused acoustic energy on kidney tissue. Material & Methods: The explanted porcine kidney was sonicated under MR-guidance by using a clinical Focused Ultrasound (FUS) system (ExAblate 2000 Body system, InSightec, Haifa, Israel). The study employed MR-based temperature mapping (Proton Resonance Frequency method) for control of the ablation. The data of temperature measurement has been compared to histological analysis of treated tissues. Results: The temperature mapping data demonstrated a rise of temperature at the focal point up to 440C (SD plus or minus 1), which was thought to be sufficient enough to trigger hyperthermia effects. Histopathological analysis showed tissue destruction as a result of massive cavitation in treated tissues. The signs of mechanical damage were more pronounced in a place that was treated 240 seconds compared with the first location (sonicated 120 seconds). Conclusions: The effect of FUS on the tissues of animal kidney was investigated. The achieved level of temperature rise in the focal point was high enough to induce hyperthermia suggesting possible clinical application. Histology of treated tissue indicated that its therapeutic effect was mediated by focused ultrasound. The correlation between duration of sonication and tissue damage was demonstrated.},

abstract={Testing for causality is of critical importance for many econometric applications. For bivariate AR(1) processes, the limit distributions of causality tests based on least squares estimation depend on the presence of nonstationary processes. When nonstationary processes are present, the limit distributions of such tests are usually very complicated, and the full-sample bootstrap method becomes inconsistent as pointed out in Choi (2005, Statistics and Probability Letters 75, 39-48). In this paper, a profile empirical likelihood method is proposed to test for causality. The proposed test statistic is robust against the presence of nonstationary processes in the sense the one does not have to determine the existence of nonstationary processes a priori. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed test statistic works well. Reprinted by permission of Cambridge University Press.

abstract={Background Reconstruction methods for Non-Cartesian magnetic resonance imaging have often been analyzed using the root mean square error (RMSE). However, RMSE is not able to measure the level of structured error associated with the reconstruction process. Methods An index for geometric information loss was presented using the 2D autocorrelation function. The performances of Least Squares Non Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (LS-NUFFT) and gridding reconstruction (GR) methods were compared. The Direct Summation method (DS) was used as reference. For both methods, RMSE and the loss in geometric information were calculated using a digital phantom and a hyperpolarized 13C dataset. Results The performance of the geometric information loss index was analyzed in the presence of noise. Comparing to GR, LS-NUFFT obtained a lower RMSE, but its error image appeared more structured. This was observed in both phantom and in vivo experiments. Discussion The evaluation of geometric information loss together with the reconstruction error was important for an appropriate performance analysis of the reconstruction methods. The use of geometric information loss was helpful to determine that LS-NUFFT loses relevant information in the reconstruction process, despite the low RMSE.},

abstract={The dynamics of coherent G-mode and D-mode phonons in Ar+-ion implanted graphite were investigated using transient reflectivity measurements. With an increase in the Ar+-ion dose, a coherent D-mode phonon appears at which the dephasing rate of the coherent G-mode phonon begins to increase. The increase in the amplitude of the coherent D-mode phonon and those in dephasing rates of the coherent D-mode and G-mode phonons indicate effective carrier-defect scatterings in the defective graphite. The dephasing rate of the D-mode is larger than that of the G-mode, indicating the existence of an additional dephasing process for the D-mode. This is attributed to the broad spectral distribution of the D-mode phonon, which is understood as a coherent excitation of large wavevector phonons with different wavevectors through inter-Dirac-cone scattering. The frequency chirping of the D-mode and its defect density dependence are discussed in the light of this scattering mechanism.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Time-resolved MRA imaging is a promising technique for blood flow evaluation in case of cerebrovascular malformations. Unfortunately, 4D MRA imaging is a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of temporal resolution on the error associated with TTP estimation from indicator dilution curves derived from different vascular structures.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Monte Carlo simulation was performed to compute indicator dilution curves with known criterion standard TTP at temporal resolutions between 0.1 and 5 seconds. TTPs were estimated directly and by using 4 hemodynamic models for each curve and were compared with criterion standard TTP. Furthermore, clinical evaluation was performed by using 226 indicator dilution curves from different vessel structures obtained from clinical datasets. The temporal resolution was artificially decreased, and TTPs were estimated and compared with those obtained at the original temporal resolutions. The results of the clinical evaluations were further stratified for different vessel structures.RESULTS:The results of both evaluations show that the TTP estimation error increases exponentially when one lowers the temporal resolution. TTP estimation by using hemodynamic model curves leads to lower estimation errors compared with direct estimation. A temporal resolution of 1.5 seconds for arteries and 2.5 seconds for venous and arteriovenous malformation vessel structures appears to be reasonable to achieve TTP estimations adequate for clinical application.CONCLUSIONS:Different vessel structures require different temporal resolutions to enable comparable TTP estimation errors, which should be considered for achieving a case-optimal temporal and spatial resolution.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop and validate a method to identify computationally efficient site- and patient-specific models of ultrasound thermal therapies from MR thermal images. The models of the specific absorption rate of the transduced energy and the temperature response of the therapy target are identified in the reduced basis of proper orthogonal decomposition of thermal images, acquired in response to a mild thermal test excitation. The method permits dynamic reidentification of the treatment models during the therapy by recursively utilizing newly acquired images. Such adaptation is particularly important during high-temperature therapies, which are known to substantially and rapidly change tissue properties and blood perfusion. The developed theory was validated for the case of focused ultrasound heating of a tissue phantom. The experimental and computational results indicate that the developed approach produces accurate low-dimensional treatment models despite temporal and spatial noises in MR images and slow image acquisition rate.},

abstract={MR fluid squeeze mode investigations at CVeSS have shown that MR fluids show large force capabilities in squeeze mode. It was found that MR fluids in squeeze mode may be used in a wide range of applications such as engine mounts and impact dampers. In these applications, MR fluid is flowing in a dynamic environment due to the transient nature of inputs and system characteristics. The research presented in this article undertakes the problem of dynamic testing and modeling of MR fluid squeeze mounts. Dynamic tests of an MR mount are studied for different applied currents, initial gaps, frequencies, and excitation amplitudes. An effective mathematical model of the MR squeeze mount for steady-state testing was built which includes the effect of the inertia of the fluid. The results show that the compression force and the area of the hysteresis loop increase with the increase of excitation amplitude or applied current and it will decrease with the increase of frequency or initial gap. Also, the inertia effect becomes more significant for higher displacement frequencies. The mathematical model agrees with the test data very well during the compression process and it can be used for the dynamics analysis and the real-time control.},

abstract={The modification on the microstructure of diamond films due to the addition of H sub(2 species into the Ar/CH) sub(4) plasma was investigated. While the Ar/CH sub(4 plasma produced UNCD films with equiaxed grains (about 5 nm in size), the (Ar-H) sub(2))/CH sub(4 plasma produced acicular-shaped grains (about 5 x 20 nm in size). Transmission electron microscopy studies indicate that these acicular-shaped grains actually are agglomerates of diamond flakes, which contain stacking faults lying on the (111) lattice plane. Presumably, the incorporation of H) sub(2) species in the plasma leads to partial etching of hydrocarbons adhered onto the diamond clusters, such that the C sub(2- (or active carbon) species contained in the plasma can attach to the diamond surface anisotropically, leading to diamond flakes. The incorporation of H) sub(2) in Ar plasma can also suppress the formation of i-carbons, an allotropic phase of diamonds. The critical proportion of H sub(2 in Ar plasma for inducing the changes in the granular structure is around 0.03%. The proportion of grain boundaries was thus reduced and the electron field emission properties of the materials were thus degraded. However, the suppression of the film electrical conductivity without sacrificing the smooth surface characteristic has the applications as high-thermal-conductivity heat spreaders and substrates for surface-acoustic-wave devices.)},

abstract={The real-time hybrid testing method (RT-HYTEM) is a structural testing technique in which the numerical integration of the equation of motion for a numerical substructure and the physical testing for an experimental substructure are performed simultaneously in real-time. This article presents the quantitative evaluation of the seismic performance of a building structure installed with a magnetorheological (MR) damper using RT-HYTEM. A building model is identified from the force-vibration testing results of a full-scale five-story building and is used as the numerical substructure, and an MR damper corresponding to an experimental substructure is physically tested using a universal testing machine (UTM). First, the force required to drive the displacement of the story, at which the MR damper is located, is measured from the load cell attached to the UTM. The measured force is then returned to a control computer to calculate the response of the numerical substructure. Finally, the experimental substructure is excited by the UTM with the calculated response of the numerical substructure. The RT-HYTEM implemented in this study is validated because the real-time hybrid testing results obtained by application of sinusoidal and earthquake excitations and the corresponding analytical results obtained using the Bouc-Wen model as the control force of the MR damper with respect to input currents are in good agreement. Also, the results from RT-HYTEM for the passive -on and -off control show that the structural responses did not decrease further by the excessive control force, but decreased due to the increase of the current applied to the MR damper. Also, two semi-active control algorithms (modulated homogeneous friction and the clipped-optimal control algorithms) are applied to the MR damper in order to optimally control the structural responses. To compare the RT-HYTEM and numerical results, Bouc-Wen model parameters are identified for each input current. The results of the comparison of experimental and numerical responses show that it is more practical to use RT-HYTEM in semi-active devices such as MR dampers. The test results show that a control algorithm can be experimentally applied to the MR damper using RT-HYTEM. This article provides a discussion on each algorithm with respect to the seismic performances.},

abstract={In many statistical applications, data are collected over time, and they are likely correlated. In this paper, we investigate how to incorporate the correlation information into the local linear regression. Under the assumption that the error process is an auto-regressive process, a new estimation procedure is proposed for the nonparametric regression by using local linear regression method and the profile least squares techniques. We further propose the SCAD penalized profile least squares method to determine the order of auto-regressive process. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed procedure, and to compare the performance of the proposed procedures with the existing one. From our empirical studies, the newly proposed procedures can dramatically improve the accuracy of naive local linear regression with working-independent error structure. We illustrate the proposed methodology by an analysis of real data set.},

abstract={This study proposes magnetic resonance (MR)-measurement-integrated (MR-MI) simulation, in which the difference between the computed velocity field and the phase-contrast MRI measurement data is fed back to the numerical simulation. The computational accuracy and the fundamental characteristics, such as steady characteristics and transient characteristics, of the MR-MI simulation were investigated by a numerical experiment.

abstract={OBJECTIVETo develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in individual subjects using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification of structural MR (sMR) images.BACKGROUNDLibraries of sMR scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects.METHODSOne hundred ninety patients with probable AD were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from sMR scans to give STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score; and Models II and III use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-score. Data from 140 AD and 140 CN were used for training. The SVM parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation (CV). The remaining independent sample of 50 AD and 50 CN was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm.RESULTSThe CV accuracy of Model II and Model III aSTAND-scores was 88.5% and 89.3%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary AD pathology.CONCLUSIONSThis paper presents preliminary evidence that application of SVM-based classification of an individual sMR scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of AD. Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract={The most widely used configuration of MR dampers incorporates an annular gap through which the magnetically active MR fluid is forced to flow. The damping force, which is also known as the restoring force and opposes the applied external force, is produced by the movement of the MR fluid through this annular gap. The design of this annular gap usually utilises an approximation that represents this assembly as a flow of fluids between two infinitely wide parallel plates. This assumption has been found to be fairly accurate and sufficient for engineering design purposes, especially when the size of the annular gap is small relative to the mean radius of the annulus, which is usually the case for MR dampers. However, it is still important to have expressions that represent the physical processes exactly. In this paper, the general solutions are derived and the corresponding methodology for representing exactly the flow of fluids with a yield stress through annuli is given. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were also carried out to validate the general expressions presented. The general expression is applicable to any models of fluids with a yield stress. An example of the application of the general analytical expressions using the Herschel-Buckley model is given, and the limitations of the parallel-plate approximation is illustrated for configurations whereby the size of the annular gap relative to the mean radius is large. A mathematical model for a double-tube MR damper fabricated at the University of Manchester, UK is developed based on the annular solution and on the compressibility of MR fluid inside the chambers. It is shown that the modelling procedure represents the MR damper satisfactorily.},

abstract={French nuclear codes include flaw assessment procedures: the RSE-M Code 'Rules for In-service Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components' and the RCC-MR code 'Design and Construction Rules for Mechanical Components of FBR Nuclear Islands and High Temperature Applications'. Development of analytical methods has been made for the last 10 years in the framework of a collaboration between CEA, EDF and AREVA-NP, and by R&D actions involving CEA and IRSN. These activities have led to a unification of the common methods of the two codes. The calculation of fracture mechanics parameters, in particular the stress intensity factor KI and the J integral, has been widely developed for industrial configurations. All the developments have been integrated in the 2005 edition of RSE-M and in 2007 edition of RCC-MR. This series of articles consists of 5 parts: the first part presents an overview of the methods proposed in the RCC-MR and RSE-M codes. Parts II-IV provide the compendia for specific components. The geometries are plates (part II), pipes (part III) and elbows (part IV). This part presents validation of the methods, with details on the process followed for their development and of the evaluation accuracy of the proposed analytical methods.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEIntegration of 3-D electroanatomic mapping with Computed Tomographic (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is gaining acceptance to facilitate catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. This is critically dependent on accurate integration of electroanatomic maps with CT or MR images. We sought to examine the effect of patient- and technique-related factors on integration accuracy of electroanatomic mapping with CT and MR imaging of the left atrium.MATERIALS AND METHODSSixty-one patients undergoing catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures were included. All patients underwent cardiac CT (n = 11) or MR (n = 50) imaging, and image integration with real-time electroanatomic mapping of the aorta and left atrium (LA). CARTO-Merge software (Biosense-Webster) was used to calculate the overall average accuracy of integration of electroanatomic points with the CT and MR-derived reconstructions of the LA and aorta.RESULTSThere was a significant correlation between LA size assessed by electroanatomic mapping (112 +/- 31 ml) and average integration error (1.9 +/- 0.6 mm) (r = 0.46, p = 0.0003). There was also greater integration error for patients with LA volume >/= 110 ml (n = 31) versus < 110 ml (n = 30) (p = 0.004). In contrast, there was no significant association between average integration error and paroxysmal versus persistent AF, left ventricular ejection fraction, days from imaging to electroanatomic mapping, or images derived from CT versus MR.CONCLUSIONSPatients with larger LA volume may be prone to greater error during integration of electroanatomic mapping with CT and MR imaging. Strategies to reduce integration error may therefore be especially useful in patients with large LA volume.},

abstract={The Gafchromic XR type R film is a suitable dosimeter to determine the map of the skin dose in patients undergone complex interventional radiological procedures, such as cardiology ones. The need of preventing or locating possible skin injuries due to high doses administered to patients-as recommended by international organizations-wants the introduction in patient dosimetry of a dosimeter easy to handle, with low dependence of the response on energy in the typical radiological range, and extended measurable dose range. XR type R films fulfil all these requirements and moreover may be quickly analyzed by cheap commercial scanners. In order to determine skin-dose values by XR-R, a film calibration curve is required. In this work, validation of the XR-R dosimetry has been performed for the determination of the skin dose: maximum skin-dose values in 14 patients undergone radiofrequency ablation and pacemaker implant procedures have been determined by XR-R calibrated films. A comparison between skin-dose values determined by XR-R films and retrospective ionometric measurements has pointed out some discrepancies in the results, due to difficulties in retrospectively reproducing the real procedure settings, where XR-R film dosimetry is related to the specific patient procedure, even, in very complex interventional settings.},

abstract={Medical image segmentation plays an instrumental role in clinical diagnosis. An ideal medical image segmentation scheme should possess some preferred properties such as minimum user interaction, fast computation, and accurate and robust segmentation results. In this paper, an automated algorithm is proposed to enable the doctors to detect the presence of abnormal tissues in brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs).The merged image of different weighted images of each slice is obtained by averaging the intensities of pixels and is enhanced based on their local information by variance mapping. The abnormal regions are segmented by using minimum error thresholding method by formulating a criterion function. The segmentation is performed on the real data of MRI images for different abnormalities and the results are compared with radiologist labeled ground truth. Quantitative analysis between ground truth and segmented abnormal region is presented in terms of Percent Match and Correspondence Ratio. A maximum average percent match of 98.56% and correspondence ratio of 0.8892 of an MRI data is obtained.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEDevelop a method to quantify the cross-sectional area of the pubic portion of the levator ani muscle, validate the method in women with unilateral muscle defects, and report preliminary findings in those women.METHODMulti-planar proton density magnetic resonance images of 12 women with a unilateral defect in the pubic portion of their levator ani were selected from a larger study of levator ani muscle anatomy in women with and without genital prolapse. Three-dimensional bilateral models of the levator ani were reconstructed (using 3-D Slicer, version 2.1b1) and divided into iliococcygeal and pubic portions. Muscle cross-sectional areas were calculated at four equally spaced locations perpendicular to a line drawn from the pubic origin to the visceral insertion using the I-DEAS computer modeling software.RESULTSThe cross-sectional area of the muscle on the side with the defect was smaller than the normal side at all the four locations. The average bilateral difference was up to 81% at location 1 (nearest pubic origin). Almost all of the volume difference (13.7%, P=0.0004) was attributable to a reduction in the pubic portion (24.6%, P<0.0001), not the iliococcygeal portion (P=0.64), of the muscle.CONCLUSIONSA method was developed to quantify cross-sectional area of the pubic portion of the levator ani perpendicular to the intact muscle direction. Significant bilateral cross-sectional area differences were found between intact and defective muscles in women with a unilateral defect.},

abstract={PURPOSETo validate the accuracy of ventricular function analysis using a single breath-hold real-time steady sate free precession (SSFP) cine MR method and demonstrate its application during adenosine stress imaging in children with congenital heart disease.MATERIALS AND METHODSTwenty-eight subjects with congenital heart disease were studied (mean age 12.4 +/- 2.3 years) with MR imaging at 1.5 T. Short-axis images covering the entirety of both ventricles were acquired at rest, with a conventional segmented SSFP cine sequence acquired over multiple breath-holds and a single breath-hold real-time SSFP sequence. Seventeen subjects were given an infusion of adenosine, and the single breath-hold real-time short-axis stack was repeated during stress. Two independent observers performed the ventricular function analysis. Data was compared between the 2 acquisition methods at rest and between the single breath-hold acquisition at rest and during adenosine stress.RESULTSThere was good agreement between the multiple breath-hold and single breath-hold methods for measurement of end-diastolic volume (r = 0.95 and 0.96, p < .0001) and end-systolic volume (ESV) (r = 0.76 and 0.90, p < .0001) for the left and right ventricles respectively, and the left ventricular mass (r = 0.97, p < .0001). Adenosine was administered safely to all subjects. During stress there were significant changes in the heart rate and ESV, which led to a significant increase in cardiac output (mean 1.5 +/- 1.0 L/min, p < .001).CONCLUSIONSingle breath-hold real-time SSFP cine imaging is robust and accurate in assessing cardiac function in children with congenital heart disease. An application of this method is the rapid assessment of cardiac function during adenosine stress.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to develop and implement an algorithm for the co-registration of 3D breast MRI sets acquired at two slightly different patient positions (repetitive examination). Combined translation and rotation with locally varying parameters were applied for the purpose of coordinate transformation. A phantom allowing selective changes of the volume of the glandular tissue model was developed, in order to prove the robustness of the proposed matcher against local changes. Serial 3D data sets of phantoms and volunteers were acquired to validate the routines. Co-registration was performed using mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure of the matching of the acquired images. In the phantom study, the phantom was deliberately shifted and rotated around horizontal and vertical axes. Starting the registration with global translations using a rigid matcher, the horizontal (phi) and vertical (theta) rotation angles were optimized in an iteration loop for each slice. This method was then applied to the breast data sets. Application of the algorithm on serial 3D MR data sets improved the co-registration especially in consideration of varying local tissue volumes. The algorithm represents a compromise between a pure rigid and an elastic 3D matcher.},

This paper explores alternate methods using the information in a complex impedance network reduction and presents an alternate method that provides comparable X/R ratios and conservatism without the need to preform dual network reductions.},

abstract={ANSI/IEEE and IEC standards provide procedures that do a fairly good job in obtaining a single fault point X/R ratio that will allow a conservative estimate of the dc component and, therefore, the total fault current flowing in a breaker. However, there are circuit configurations that result in overly conservative or under conservative estimates of the fault X/R ratio. This paper explores alternate methods using the information in a complex impedance network reduction and presents an alternate method that provides comparable X/R ratios and conservatism without the need to preform dual network reductions.},

abstract={UNLABELLEDMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is uniquely suited to study the pathophysiology of arteriosclerosis. So far, magnetic resonance (MR) measurements of vessel dimensions have mainly been done by manual tracing of vessel wall contours. However, such data postprocessing is very time-consuming and has limited accuracy due to difficulties in precise tracing of the thin vessel wall.PURPOSETo assess the accuracy and reproducibility of quantitative vascular MR imaging applying a data analysis method based on (1) vessel wall unwrapping, followed by (2) a gradient detection algorithm for MR data postprocessing. Vascular MR imaging studies were done both in vessel phantoms and in healthy volunteers (n=29) on a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner. A dark blood double-inversion turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression was applied, with proton-density-weighted and breath-hold acquisition for aortic imaging and T2-weighted acquisition for carotid imaging. Intraobserver and interobserver variability were systematically evaluated by two independent observers. A repeat study within 10 days of the first MRI was performed in 10 of these subjects for assessment of interstudy reproducibility.RESULTSThe semiautomated edge detection software revealed a clear view of the inner and outer vessel wall boundaries both in the phantoms and in the volunteers studied. There was close agreement between MR-derived measurements and phantom dimensions (mean difference of 1.1+/-16.9 mm2, 8.0+/-19.9 mm2, 9.0+/-12.1 mm2 for vessel wall cross-sectional area, inner vessel area, and total vessel area, respectively). Quantification of vessel dimensions was feasible in all 29 healthy volunteers studied. Semiautomated quantification of cross-sectional vessel wall area (mean+/-SD, 253.6+/-208.4 mm2) revealed close correlation for repeated measurements by one or two observers (r=0.99 each). Both intraobserver and interobserver variability of vessel wall area MR measurements were low (mean difference 7.5+/-16.7 mm2 and 14.4+/-24.6 mm2 , respectively). In the repeat study of 10 volunteers, MRI with semiautomated postprocessing quantitation revealed a high correlation and agreement of vessel dimensions between the two scans (r=0.994, mean difference 2.6+/-25.1 mm2).CONCLUSIONSemiautomated analysis methods can provide approaches that benefit from the human understanding of the image and the computer's ability to measure precisely and rapidly. Thus, by combining the latest MRI methods and semiautomated image analysis methods, we are now able to reproducibly determine the geometric parameters of blood vessels.},

Experiments were conducted on 25-35 kg Yorkshire pigs (N = 5) under ketamine/isoflurane anesthesia. Ventilation and perfusion MR images were obtained using laser polarized gas and gadolinium (Gd), respectively. The mutual information-based technique was used to quantify the initial misregistration between the acquired ventilation and perfusion images, to cope with different intensity characteristics. Means and standard deviations (SDs) of misregistrations for the five subjects, in terms of absolute translation and absolute rotations around each of the three coordinate axes, were computed to evaluate the hypothesis. For qualitative illustrations, plots of mutual information values under absolute translations and rotations around each of the three coordinate axes are presented. This preliminary study shows the feasibility of acquiring functional image data that are spatially co-registered. This method has potential applications in the quantitative assessment of regional alveolar ventilation and pulmonary perfusion ratio, in both normal and diseased lung.},

This study has involved measurements of capacitance as a function of voltage and temperature as well as deep level transient spectroscopy measurements on Schottky-barriers diodes. The Schottky contacts were fabricated conventionally by depositing Au in a vacuum onto the etched AlGaAs surface. For a reference the Schottky diodes of the best quality were produced in-situ by evaporation of Al on the top of the epi-layer at the end of the MBE growth run. On the basis of the results of a comparative study deep-level defects related to the subsurface damaged layer have been recognised. Emission signatures as well as depth profiles of the defect concentration have been studied and analysed. Moreover, DLTS spectra revealed the presence of a well-known DX(Si) centre and M-type defect related level attributed to a vacancy and impurity complex. The presence of an additional deep-level defect located in the lower half of the energy gap that was induced by dry etching is also suggested. An extra defect considered has the high enough concentration to disturb carrier spatial profiles and DX centre characteristics. It is suggested that it may be responsible for degradation effects in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure lasers, which fabricating involves dry etching.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEWe performed a prospective clinical test of a high-spatial-resolution model-based parametric method for diagnosis of breast lesions detected on contrast-enhanced MR imaging.SUBJECTS AND METHODSFifty-seven women with 68 pathologically confirmed breast lesions were imaged (45 masses, 23 microcalcifications). Seven consecutive 2-min three-dimensional gradient-recalled echo acquisitions were performed after suitably timed gadopentetate dimeglumine injections. We derived a composite parametric image from three judiciously selected time points (three-time-point method), using a model-based kinetic algorithm. In this composite image, color brightness and hue signify contrast uptake and washout characteristics related to the product of microvessel surface area and permeability, as well as to the extracellular volume fraction. The reviewer was provided with the slice location of lesions, but with no other radiographic or clinical information. The reviewer then classified the lesions as benign or malignant using a 5-step receiver operating characteristic scale.RESULTSObservers using the three-time-point method correctly diagnosed 27 of 31 malignant and 31 of 37 benign lesions (sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 84%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.911. False-negative results were found for three patients with low- to intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ and one patient with 5-mm invasive ductal cancer. For the 45 solid lesions, sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 82%, respectively.CONCLUSIONApplication of the three-time-point method permitted, in most cases, differentiation of malignant and benign lesions, even in the presence of complex breast enhancement patterns. Sensitivity for solid tumors was higher than for ductal carcinoma in situ.},

abstract={A detailed analysis procedure is described for evaluating rates of volumetric change in brain structures based on structural magnetic resonance (MR) images. In this procedure, a series of image processing tools have been employed to address the problems encountered in measuring rates of change based on structural MR images. These tools include an algorithm for intensity non-uniformity correction, a robust algorithm for three-dimensional image registration with sub-voxel precision and an algorithm for brain tissue segmentation. However, a unique feature in the procedure is the use of a fractional volume model that has been developed to provide a quantitative measure for the partial volume effect. With this model, the fractional constituent tissue volumes are evaluated for voxels at the tissue boundary that manifest partial volume effect, thus allowing tissue boundaries be defined at a sub-voxel level and in an automated fashion. Validation studies are presented on key algorithms including segmentation and registration. An overall assessment of the method is provided through the evaluation of the rates of brain atrophy in a group of normal elderly subjects for which the rate of brain atrophy due to normal aging is predictably small. An application of the method is given in Part II where the rates of brain atrophy in various brain regions are studied in relation to normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract={In canonical vector time series autoregressions, which permit dependence only on past values, the errors generally show contemporaneous correlation. By contrast structural vector autoregressions allow contemporaneous series dependence and assume errors with no contemporaneous correlation. Such models having a recursive structure can be described by a directed acyclic graph. We show, with the use of a real example, how the identification of these models may be assisted by examination of the conditional independence graph of contemporaneous and lagged variables. In this example we identify the causal dependence of monthly Italian bank loan interest rates on government bond and repurchase agreement rates. When the number of series is larger, the structural modelling of the canonical errors alone is a useful initial step, and we first present such an example to demonstrate the general approach to identifying a directed graphical model.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and manifests both physical and neurocognitive disabilities. Although predominantly a disease of the white matter, MS is also characterized by lesions in the gray matter. Previous pathologic studies have found that cortical and deep gray matter lesions comprised 5% and 4%, respectively, of total lesions. Using software for lesion detection and quantitation, our study was designed to determine MS involvement in the cortical and deep gray matter and to correlate gray matter lesion load with neurocognitive function and the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale.METHODSUsing a semiautomated segmentation algorithm that detected and delineated all possible brain MS lesions on MR images, we investigated gray matter lesion volume in 18 patients with untreated relapsing-remitting MS. Cortical and deep gray matter lesions then were correlated with the neurocognitive and physical disability measurements.RESULTSWe found that cortical gray matter lesions comprised approximately 5.7% of the total lesion volume, whereas deep gray matter lesions comprised another 4.6% in this patient cohort. No strong correlations were found between gray matter lesions and disability status or neurocognitive function.CONCLUSIONThese results are similar to those found in previous pathologic studies. The cortical lesion load in cases of relapsing-remitting MS, as measured by MR imaging, represents less than 6% of the total lesion volume and does not correlate with disability measures or neurocognitive tests.},

abstract={PURPOSETo test the hypotheses that open dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can (a) be used to evaluate and define normal shoulder motion in active joint motion and muscle contraction and (b) be used in conjunction with physical examination.MATERIALS AND METHODSWith an open-configuration, 0.5-T MR imaging system and active image-plane tracking, 10 shoulders were studied in five asymptomatic subjects to establish normal patterns of glenohumeral motion during abduction and adduction and internal and external rotation. Preliminary studies of physical examination during MR imaging, in which a physician examiner applied mechanical force to the humeral head, were also performed.RESULTSDuring abduction and adduction and internal and external rotation maneuvers with active subjects muscle contraction, the humeral head remained precisely centered on the glenoid fossa in all asymptomatic subjects, which is in agreement with findings of previous radiographic studies. Application of force to the humeral head by an examiner was associated with as much as 6 mm of anterior translation and 13 mm of posterior translation.CONCLUSIONDynamic MR imaging of the glenohumeral joint is possible over a wide range of physiologic motion in vertically open systems. Use of an MR tracking coil enabled accurate tracking of the anatomy of interest. These preliminary measurements of normal glenohumeral motion patterns begin to establish normal ranges of motion and constitute a necessary first step in characterizing pathologic motion in patients with common clinical problems such as instability and impingement.},

abstract={The goal of this study was to put together several techniques of image segmentation to provide a reliable assessment of the left ventricular mass with short-axis cardiac MR images. No initial manual input was required for this process based on region growing, gradient detection, and adaptive thresholding. A comparison between actual mass and automatic assessment was implemented with 9 minipigs that underwent spin-echo MR imaging. Fifteen normal volunteers were studied with a fast-gradient-echo sequence. The automatic segmentation was then controlled by three trained observers. Actual mass and automatic segmentation were strongly correlated (r = .97 with P < .01). For normal volunteers, the standard error of estimation of the automatic assessment (12 g) compared well with the average myocardial mass (120 +/- 30 g) and the interobserver reproducibility of the manual assessment (9 g). These results allow the application of this method to the quantification of the left ventricular function and mass in clinical practice.},

abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using blood oxygenation contrast has rapidly spread into many application areas. In this paper, a new statistical model is used to evaluate the reliability of fMRI activation in a finger opposition motor paradigm for both within-session and between-session data and in a working memory paradigm for between-session data. A slice prescription procedure for between-session reproducibility is introduced. Estimates are made for the probabilities of correctly and falsely classifying voxels as active or inactive and receiver operator characteristic curves are generated. In the motor paradigm, estimated between-session reliability was found to be somewhat reduced relative to within-session reliability; however, this includes additional sources of variation and may not reflect intrinsically lower reliability. After matching false-positive classification probabilities, between-session reliability was found to be nearly identical for both motor and cognitive activation paradigms.},

abstract={MR imaging experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility of estimating vascular pulse pressure waveforms from measurements of blood flow rates and vessel cross-sectional area. Blood flow waveforms were measured in the aorta's of three 25-30-kg pigs at multiple imaging sections using phase-contrast velocity imaging. Estimates of pulse pressure were derived from these data by evaluating a model characterizing the relationship between pressure, flow, and the cross-sectional area of a vessel segment. Comparisons between the MR-derived estimates of pressure and those obtained from a micromanometer pressure catheter indicate that accurate measurements (mean error +/- SD = 8.2 +/- 3.4, n = 6) can be obtained using conventional velocity imaging techniques. Optimization of the method will require the application of rapid imaging techniques and the development of strategies for obtaining a more localized measurement. With these improvements, our results suggest that MR-based measurement of pulse pressure and related elastic parameters is feasible.},

abstract={Respiratory ordered phase encoding is often employed in MRI studies to reduce image artifacts due to breathing motion. The purpose of this work was to evaluate error caused by the use of respiratory ordering of phase encoding in MR cine phase-contrast (CPC) volumetric flow measurements when the flow rate is sensitive to respiration. It was hypothesized that this effect is due to the systematic biasing of a respiratory-induced phase modulation function in k-space. A theoretical model for the effects of respiration was developed and then tested in flow phantom studies and in normal volunteer studies. In phantom experiments, the use of respiratory ordering induced an error of as much as 13% in CPC volumetric flow measurements. In preliminary volunteer studies, error was as high as 26% in superior vena cava flow measurements versus less than 1% error in the ascending aorta. It is concluded that a potential for error exists in CPC volumetric flow measurements obtained with the use of respiratory ordering schemes. Volunteer studies with larger numbers are warranted. Clinical applications in which this effect may be important include flow measurements in vessels subject to variations in flow due to respiration, such as the venae cavae, pulmonary vasculature, and portal vein.},

abstract={Magnetic resonance is recognized as potentially the best imaging procedure for localization in stereotactic neurosurgery. However, special difficulties necessitate specific adaptation to localize targets in the stereotactic frame. We developed a new method for stereotactic localization. The MR studies were performed using a 0.5 T imager. Four small boxes filled with CuSO4 solution were inserted into the intracranial holders of a Talairach frame. Using fast sequences, thirty 7-mm thick contiguous sagittal slices and twenty 5-mm thick axial slices enabled us to image the entire brain. The image data were transferred for analysis to an image processing station, including special software to handle stereotactic calculations. The accuracy of the origin of the trihedron and systematic geometrical errors were carefully evaluated using a cubic phantom, and corrective algorithms were applied when needed. Moreover, checks have been designed to detect geometrical distortion due to ferromagnetic artifacts, alterations in gradient calibration, or movements made by the patient. This localization method does not necessitate the use of stereotactic frames and appears to be precise enough for clinical use. Duration of MR examination is not a restricting factor, mainly because the patient can be positioned easily.},
