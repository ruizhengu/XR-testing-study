abstract={The drying-free preparation of coated magnetic particles has been proven to significantly improve the comprehensive performance and preparation efficiency of magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Due to the magnetic separation technique in the drying-free process, the residual anhydrous ethanol and silicone oil form a Pickering emulsion, whose influence on the properties of MR fluid is ignored in existing mechanical models. In this study, in order to improve the application accuracy of MR fluid and provide methods for further improvement of MR fluid performance, with consideration of the influence of the Pickering emulsion caused by the drying-free process, the tight simple cubic (TSC) structure model and the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure model of MR fluid were proposed based on the mechanism of chain formation of MR fluid and the magnetic dipole theory. To reflect the coexistence and transformation mechanism of these two structures, a distribution probability function was introduced and a hybrid spatial structure model comprised of both TSC and BCC structures was established. The validity and accuracy of the models were verified by the comparison with the experimental data. The proposed hybrid spatial structure micromechanical model considers the influence of Pickering emulsion on the microstructure of MR fluid and can accurately describe the properties of MR fluid prepared by the drying-free process.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a growing trend in cognitive psychology research towards recreating experimental situations in virtual reality (VR). VR settings are thought to have higher ecological validity than laboratory settings using digital, two-dimensional (2D) pictures. Some studies have shown cognitive performance in VR settings to follow that of the real world. However, other studies obtained controversial results. The present study tested the memory performance of three groups of participants who were exposed to the same environment (a room) through different modalities: in real life, in VR, and through 2D pictures. The results highlighted that participants who were exposed to the target room in real life had an overall better memory performance, compared to participants who saw the room in VR or through 2D pictures. On the other hand, no differences in memory performance emerged between the VR and 2D picture groups, except for the non-suggestive verbal task. The results suggest that future research should be careful in assuming that performance in VR settings is comparable to real life and that VR is more ecological than traditional 2D media.},

abstract={ObjectivesIn this study, we aimed to compare conventional and T1-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) in the diagnosis and grading of glenoid cartilage defects that accompany labral pathologies.Materials and methodsA total of 79 patients who were prediagnosed with labrum pathologies based on shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had MRA and CTA between December 2021 and May 2022. CTA was regarded as reference standard. CTA images were examined by a radiologist experienced in musculoskeletal radiology, and MRA images were examined by two radiologists independently to determine presence, grade, and localization of any glenoid cartilage defect, if present. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated separately for conventional and T1-weighted volumetric MRA. In addition, at the last stage, two observers examined all MRAs together, and the presence of a cartilage defect was decided by consensus, and the overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated.ResultsCartilage defect was detected on CTAs of 48 (60.75%) cases of among 79 patients with labrum pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of conventional MRA for two examiners were 17–19%, 100–100%, and 49–51%, respectively, while those values were 67–65%, 92–97%, and 84–77%, respectively, for T1-weighted volumetric MRA. Inter-examiner agreement was excellent for diagnosis of cartilage defects on all MRAs. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection of glenoid cartilage lesions by MRA were 69%, 97%, and 80%, respectively.ConclusionT1-weighted volumetric MRA seems to demonstrate cartilage defects accompanied with labrum pathologies accurately with high sensitivity, specificity, and excellent inter-examiner agreement.},

abstract={PurposeConcomitant with the significant advances in computing technology, the utilization of augmented reality-based navigation in clinical applications is being actively researched. In this light, we developed novel object tracking and depth realization technologies to apply augmented reality-based neuronavigation to brain surgery.MethodsWe developed real-time inside-out tracking based on visual inertial odometry and a visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm. The cube quick response marker and depth data obtained from light detection and ranging sensors are used for continuous tracking. For depth realization, order-independent transparency, clipping, and annotation and measurement functions were developed. In this study, the augmented reality model of a brain tumor patient was applied to its life-size three-dimensional (3D) printed model.ResultsUsing real-time inside-out tracking, we confirmed that the augmented reality model remained consistent with the 3D printed patient model without flutter, regardless of the movement of the visualization device. The coordination accuracy during real-time inside-out tracking was also validated. The average movement error of the X and Y axes was 0.34 ± 0.21 and 0.04 ± 0.08 mm, respectively. Further, the application of order-independent transparency with multilayer alpha blending and filtered alpha compositing improved the perception of overlapping internal brain structures. Clipping, and annotation and measurement functions were also developed to aid depth perception and worked perfectly during real-time coordination. We named this system METAMEDIP navigation.ConclusionsThe results validate the efficacy of the real-time inside-out tracking and depth realization technology. With these novel technologies developed for continuous tracking and depth perception in augmented reality environments, we are able to overcome the critical obstacles in the development of clinically applicable augmented reality neuronavigation.},

abstract={One limitation on the ability to monitor health in older adults using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the presence of implants, where the prevalence of implantable devices (orthopedic, cardiac, neuromodulation) increases in the population, as does the pervasiveness of conditions requiring MRI studies for diagnosis (musculoskeletal diseases, infections, or cancer). The present study describes a novel multiphysics implant modeling testbed using the following approaches with two examples: (1) an in silico human model based on the widely available Visible Human Project (VHP) cryo-section dataset; (2) a finite element method (FEM) modeling software workbench from Ansys (Electronics Desktop/Mechanical) to model MR radio frequency (RF) coils and the temperature rise modeling in heterogeneous media. The in silico VHP-Female model (250 parts with an additional 40 components specifically characterizing embedded implants and resultant surrounding tissues) corresponds to a 60-year-old female with a body mass index of 36. The testbed includes the FEM-compatible in silico human model, an implant embedding procedure, a generic parameterizable MRI RF birdcage two-port coil model, a workflow for computing heat sources on the implant surface and in adjacent tissues, and a thermal FEM solver directly linked to the MR coil simulator to determine implant heating based on an MR imaging study protocol. The primary target is MR labeling of large orthopedic implants. The testbed has very recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device development tool for 1.5 T orthopedic implant examinations.},

abstract={ObjectivesThe Trier social stress test (TSST) is one of the most reliable and widely used laboratory tests for evaluating the physiological stress response. We developed a virtual reality-based TSST (VR-TSST) and investigated the physiological responses to this test in patients with psychosis and healthy controls (HCs).MethodsThe participants comprised 60 patients with psychosis and 66 HCs. The VR-TSST consisted of three scenarios: a resting phase (baseline; 2 min), a job interview (5 min), and a mental arithmetic task (5 min). Blood cortisol levels were measured at baseline, during the test, and at 5–10 min and 30 min after the test. The skin conductance level, heart rate, and RR intervals were measured at baseline, during the job interview, and during the arithmetic task.ResultsThe VR-TSST produced no discernible cortisol response in patients with psychosis compared to the HCs. However, a higher skin conductance level and heart rate and shorter RR intervals were found in the patients than in the HCs at baseline, during the job interview, and during the arithmetic task.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the current version of the VR-TSST induces stronger autonomic and cardiovascular, but not endocrine, responses in patients with psychosis than in HCs. The VR-TSST could be a valuable tool to evaluate or train the stress response in patients with psychosis.},

abstract={The Box and Block Test (BBT) has been widely used to assess gross upper extremity (UE) motor function. We designed a haptic-feedback virtual reality (VR) system, named the VBBT, to improve the BBT for more specific assessments. The VBBT task required users to move virtual blocks from one compartment of a virtual box to the other within one minute. The focus of this pilot study was to examine the validity, reliability and motivation of the novel assessment. Totally, 113 healthy subjects and 16 post-stroke patients were recruited for a thorough evaluation. We found that scores of the BBT and VBBT were significantly correlated, both of which declined as participants’ age. The normative ranges of kinematic metrics in different age groups were used to identify deficiencies in UE motor function involving smoothness, hand dexterity and motion efficiency. Also, a significant correlation between the VBBT and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) (|r|≥ 0.56) indicated concurrent validity of the novel assessment. Test–retest results indicated that the VBBT assessment had high reliability (ICCs = 0.62–0.80). The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory results showed that the VBBT was given higher scores for the enjoyment (p < 0.05) and completion effort (p < 0.05) than that for the BBT, indicating patients have greater motivation in the VBBT assessment. In conclusion, the VBBT can provide validated, reliable and motivative assessment for UE motor function with kinematic metrics. It suggests that the haptic-feedback VR contributes to the BBT in specific assessments of UE motor function.},

abstract={Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) have been widely used in health care education to simultaneously assess knowledge, skill and attitude. Due to the high cost of running an OSCE, its application in professional psychology is still limited. To solve this problem, virtual standardised patient (VSP) implementations in creating psychology OSCEs can be a cost‐effective method for administering a psychology OSCE regularly. This study aimed to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the VSP version of the Intake OSCE (VSP‐Intake OSCE) in measuring psychologists' psychological assessment competencies (PACs) from entry to early practice. The initial development of the VSP‐Intake OSCE contains a VSP station and a follow‐up written station to measure PACs when conducting an intake assessment. To administer the VSP station, we built a new VSP system that allows psychologists to interact with a VSP verbally. A sample of 36 participants, including 27 graduate students and nine psychologists, were recruited to examine the psychometric properties of the VSP‐Intake OSCE. As a newly developed instrument, the VSP‐Intake OSCE revealed good inter‐rater reliability and construct validity. We believe using VSP implementations to develop psychology OSCEs will be essential in promoting OSCE applications in professional psychology.},

abstract={The latest technological advancements in the domain of virtual reality (VR) have created new opportunities to use VR as a training platform for medical students and practitioners more broadly. Despite the growing interest in the use of VR as a training tool, a commonly identified gap in VR-training for medical education is the confidence in the long-term validity of the applications. A systematic literature review was undertaken to explore the extent of VR (in particular head-mounted displays) applications for medical training with an additional focus on validation measures. The papers included in this review discussed empirical case studies of specific applications; however, these were mostly concerned with human-computer interaction and were polarized between demonstrating that a conceptual technology solution was feasible for simulation or looked at specific areas of VR usability with little discussion on validation measures for long-term training effectiveness and outcomes. The review uncovered a wide range of ad hoc applications and studies in terms of technology vendors, environments, tasks, envisaged users and effectiveness of learning outcomes. This presents decision-making challenges for those seeking to adopt, implement and embed such systems in teaching practice. The authors of this paper then take a wider socio-technical systems perspective to understand how the holistic training system can be engineered and validated effectively as fit for purpose, through distillation of a generic set of requirements from the literature review to aid design specification and implementation, and to drive more informed and traceable validation of these types of systems. In this review, we have identified 92 requirement statements in 11 key areas against which a VR-HMD training system could be validated; these were grouped into design considerations, learning mechanisms and implementation considerations.},

abstract={PURPOSETo report the application of LUXIE and validate its reliability by comparing the test results with those of Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 (HFA3).METHODSIn this pilot study, we prospectively recruited participants who had received HFA3 SITA standard 30-2 perimetry and tested them with LUXIE on the same day. LUXIE is a software designed for visual field testing cooperating with HTC Vive Pro Eye, a head-mounted virtual reality device with an eye-tracking system. The test stimuli were synchronized with eye movements captured by the eye-tracking system to eliminate fixation loss. The global, hemifields, quadrants, glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) sectors, and point-by-point retinal sensitivities were compared between LUXIE and HFA3. All participants were asked to fill out a post-test user survey.RESULTSThirty-eight participants with 65 eyes were enrolled. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3 in global (r = 0.81), superior hemifield (r = 0.77), superonasal, superotemporal, and inferonasal quadrants (r = 0.80, 0.78, 0.80). The user survey showed that participants were more satisfied with LUXIE in operating difficulty, comfortability, time perception, concentration, and overall satisfaction.CONCLUSIONSLUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3. Fixation loss could be eliminated in LUXIE with the eye-tracking system. The application of virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye makes telemedicine and even home-based self-screening visual field tests possible.KEY MESSAGES1. Virtual reality perimetry is a developing technology that has the potential in telemedicine, and home self-screening visual field tests. 2. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 in visual field retinal sensitivities.},

abstract={Research suggests that interpersonal approach-avoidance behaviours influence group evaluations. However, previous work partly neglected the multi-sensory and contextual cues at stake during interpersonal interactions and may offer a limited picture of the phenomenon. Here, we argue that immersive virtual reality (IVR) represents a useful tool to address this issue. In IVR, we implemented interpersonal approach-avoidance behaviours and tested their construct validity. Based on a careful examination of the literature, we defined two construct validity criteria: the evaluative influence of repeated approach-avoidance behaviours as well as the activation of the corresponding neuropsychological systems. In two experiments (NExp1 = 199, NExp2 = 205), we tested whether, compared to avoidance, approach leads to more positive group evaluations on self-report, reaction time based and behavioural intention measures. Additionally, we investigated whether the IVR operationalisations influence the neuropsychological systems assumed to underlie approach-avoidance behaviours. Overall, the findings are not consistent with the hypotheses and do not conclusively validate our IVR approach-avoidance operationalisation. Although additional research should examine more thoroughly the issues raised by the current work by investigating new ways of implementing approach-avoidance in IVR, the present contribution paves the way for such future developments. Despite these challenges, we encourage a consideration of the full-fledged subtleties of social interactions via adequate tools (IVR) for the study of approach-avoidance.},

abstract={ObjectivesTo evaluate whether lung perfusion continues to be reduced in 10-year-old children after congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and whether lung perfusion values correlate with spirometric lung function measurements.MethodsFifty-four patients after CDH repair received dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based lung perfusion measurements at the age of 10 years (10.2 ± 1.0 years). Additionally, a control group of 10 children has been examined according to the same protocol. Lung spirometry was additionally available in 43 patients of the CDH group. A comparison of ipsilateral and contralateral parameters was performed.ResultsPulmonary blood flow (PBF) was reduced on the ipsilateral side in CDH patients (60.4 ± 23.8 vs. 93.3 ± 16.09 mL/100 mL/min; p < 0.0001). In comparison to the control group, especially the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral, PBF was reduced in CDH patients (0.669 ± 0.152 vs. 0.975 ± 0.091; p < 0.0001). There is a positive correlation between ipsilateral pulmonary blood flow, and spirometric forced 1-s volume (r = 0.45; p = 0.0024).ConclusionsPulmonary blood flow impairment persists during childhood and correlates with spirometric measurements. Without the need for ionizing radiation, MRI measurements seem promising as follow-up parameters after CDH.Key Points• Ten-year-old children after congenital diaphragmatic hernia continue to show reduced perfusion of ipsilateral lung.• Lung perfusion values correlate with lung function tests after congenital diaphragmatic hernia.},

abstract={Magnetic rings are widely used in automotive, home appliances, and consumer electronics. Due to the materials used, processing techniques, and other factors, there will be top cracks, internal cracks, adhesion, and other defects on individual magnetic rings during the manufacturing process. To find such defects, the most sophisticated YOLOv5 target identification algorithm is frequently utilized. However, it has problems such as high computation, sluggish detection, and a large model size. This work suggests an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 (MR-YOLO) approach for the identification of magnetic ring surface defects to address these issues. To decrease the floating-point operation (FLOP) in the feature channel fusion process and enhance the performance of feature expression, the YOLOv5 neck network was added to the Mobilenetv3 module. To improve the robustness of the algorithm, a Mosaic data enhancement technique was applied. Moreover, in order to increase the network’s interest in minor defects, the SE attention module is inserted into the backbone network to replace the SPPF module with substantially more calculations. Finally, to further increase the new network’s accuracy and training speed, we substituted the original CIoU-Ioss for SIoU-Loss. According to the test, the FLOP and Params of the modified network model decreased by 59.4% and 47.9%, respectively; the reasoning speed increased by 16.6%, the model’s size decreased by 48.1%, and the mAP only lost by 0.3%. The effectiveness and superiority of this method are proved by an analysis and comparison of examples.},

abstract={A critical chemotherapeutic complication is cardiotoxicity, often leading, in time, to heart failure. In this work, we developed a novel animal protocol using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and electrophysiology (EP) tests, designed to detect subtle structural and functional changes associated with myocardial damage in sub-chronic phases post-chemotherapy. A weekly dose of doxorubicin (DOX) was injected in four juvenile swine throughout a four-week plan, using an intravenous approach that mimics the treatment in cancer patients. We performed cardiac MR imaging as follows: in all four pigs pre-DOX; at 1 and 5 weeks post-DOX in a group of two pigs; and, at 1 and 9 weeks post-DOX in the other two pigs, using Cine imaging to assess ejection fraction (EF) and late gadolinium enhancement to quantify collagen density in the left ventricle. Additionally, X-ray-guided voltage mapping and arrhythmia tests were conducted in the group at 9 weeks post-DOX and in a healthy pig. Tissue samples were collected for histology. The results showed that EF decreased from ~46% pre-DOX to ~34% within the first 9 weeks post-DOX. This decline in LV function was explained by a gradual increase in collagen density, especially noticeable at week 9 post-DOX as derived from MRI analysis. Furthermore, ventricular fibrillation was induced via rapid pacing at 9 weeks post-DOX, most likely caused by fibrotic patches identified in voltage maps, as confirmed by MRI and collagen-sensitive histological stains. Overall, our novel preclinical protocol was able to reveal key signs of potentially-irreversible tissue changes, along with electrical remodeling and arrhythmia risk in the early months following DOX therapy. Future work will include more datasets to statistically power the study, and will use the protocol to test cardioprotective strategies.},

abstract={DC arc faults are dangerous to photovoltaic (PV) systems and can cause serious electric fire hazards and property damage. Because the PV inverter works in a high−frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) control mode, the arc fault detection is prone to nuisance tripping due to PV inverter noises. An arc fault detection method based on the autoregressive (AR) model is proposed. A test platform collects the database of this research according to the UL1699B standard, in which three different types of PV inverters are taken into consideration to make it more generalized. The arc current can be considered a nonstationary random signal while the noise of the PV inverter is not. According to the difference in randomness features between an arc and the noise, a detection method based on the AR model is proposed. The Burg algorithm is used to determine model coefficients, while the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is applied to explore the best order of the proposed model. The correlation coefficient difference of the model coefficients plays a role as a criterion to identify if there is an arc fault. Moreover, a prototype circuit based on the TMS320F28033 MCU is built for algorithm verification. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can identify an arc fault without a false positive under different PV inverter conditions. The fault clearing time is between 60 ms to 80 ms, which can meet the requirement of 200 ms specified by the standard.},

abstract={Shared automated mobility on-demand (SAMOD) is considered as a promising mobility solution in the future. Users book trips on-demand via a smartphone, and service algorithms set up virtual stops (vStop) where users then need to walk to board the automated shuttle. Navigation and identification of the virtual pickup location, which has no references in the real world, can be challenging. Providing users with an intuitive information system in that situation is essential to achieve high user acceptance of new automated mobility services. Our novel vStop human–machine interface (HMI) prototype for mobile augmented reality (AR) supports users with information in reference to the street environment. This work firstly presented the results of an online interview study (N = 21) to conceptualize an HMI. Secondly, the HMI was prototyped by means of AR and evaluated (N = 45) regarding user experience (UX), workload, and acceptance. The results show that the AR prototype provided high rates of UX especially in terms of high pragmatic quality. Furthermore, cognitive workload when using the HMI was low, and acceptance ratings were high. The results show the positive perception of AR for navigation tasks in general and the highly assistive character of the vStop prototype in particular. In the future, SAMOD services can provide customers with vStop HMIs to foster user acceptance and smooth operation of their service.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of upper-limb robot-assisted therapy based on visual error augmentation in virtual reality (UL-RAT-VEAVR) for motor recovery and kinematics after chronic hemiparetic stroke. This study applied a single-group pre- and post-intervention study design. A total of 27 stroke survivors (20 males and 7 females; mean age 54.51 years, mean onset duration 12.7 months) volunteered to participate in this study. UL-RAT-VEAVR was performed three times a week for four weeks, amounting to a total of twelve sessions, in which an end-effector-based robotic arm was used with a visual display environment in virtual reality. Each subject performed a total of 480 point-to-point movements toward 3 direction targets (medial, ipsilateral, and contralateral side) in the visual display environment system while holding the handle of the end-effector-based robotic arm. The visual error (distance to the targets on the monitor) in virtual reality was increased by 5% every week based on the subject’s maximum point-to-point reaching trajectory. Upper-limb motor recovery was measured in all subjects using the Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper-limb subscale, the Box and Block Test (BBT), and the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), before and after training. In addition, a kinematic assessment was also performed before and after training and consisted of time, speed, distance, and curvilinear ratio for point-to-point movement. There were significant improvements in both upper-limb motor function and kinematics after 4 weeks of UL-RAT-VEAVR (p < 0.05). Our results showed that the UL-RAT-VEAVR may have the potential to be used as one of the upper-limb rehabilitation strategies in chronic stroke survivors. Future studies should investigate the clinical effects of the error-augmentation paradigm using an RCT design.},

abstract={In order to solve the poor matching ability between concrete structures of traditional architectural space optimization design methods, it leads to the problem of low space optimization ratio, so based on virtual reality technology, the author proposes a new method for optimizing the space of concrete structure buildings. Using virtual reality technology to improve the basic structure of building space, reorganize the form through the design space, and optimize the design of the concrete structure building space function; based on the test model of virtual reality technology, design the matching method of concrete structure, increase the proportion of building space optimization, and adopt linear buckling method, geometric nonlinear method, and double nonlinear analysis method; the ultimate bearing capacity of steel structures of residential buildings in earthquake areas is tested. Experimental results show that for the simple structure building space, the average optimization ratios are 97.17% and 96.71%, respectively; for the complex structure building space, under the proposed optimization design, the average optimization ratio is maintained at 94.34%, and the error between the stress prediction value of the finite element model and the axial stress obtained by testing is less than 6%. Compared with the traditional space optimization design, in the proposed space optimization design method, the proportion of building space optimization is higher; it can be seen that the virtual reality technology has a better matching effect on the concrete structure, and the accuracy of the ultimate bearing capacity value obtained by prediction is high.},

abstract={We studied whether TOF reduces error propagation from attenuation correction to PET image reconstruction in PET/MR neuroimaging, by using imperfect attenuation maps in a clinical PET/MR system with 525 ps timing resolution. Ten subjects who had undergone 18F-FDG PET neuroimaging were included. Attenuation maps using a single value (0.100 cm−1) with and without air, and a 3-class attenuation map with soft tissue (0.096 cm−1), air and bone (0.151 cm−1) were used. CT-based attenuation correction was used as a reference. Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was conducted. Mean bias and standard deviation across the brain was studied. Regional correlations and concordance were evaluated. Statistical testing was conducted. Average bias and standard deviation were slightly reduced in the majority (23–26 out of 35) of the VOI with TOF. Bias was reduced near the cortex, nasal sinuses, and in the mid-brain with TOF. Bland–Altman and regression analysis showed small improvements with TOF. However, the overall effect of TOF to quantitative accuracy was small (3% at maximum) and significant only for two attenuation maps out of three at 525 ps timing resolution. In conclusion, TOF might reduce the quantitative errors due to attenuation correction in PET/MR neuroimaging, but this effect needs to be further investigated on systems with better timing resolution.},

Our results show that virtual tests had both positive and negative effects on the development, with the positive aspects clearly predominating. In summary, the tests in VR shorten the development time and reduce risks and therefore costs. Furthermore, they offer possibilities not available in real-world tests.

abstract={Background: Cognitive deficits are present in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Assessments used to measure cognition in these disorders are time-consuming, burdensome, and have low ecological validity. To address these limitations, we developed a novel virtual reality shopping task—VStore. Objective: This study aims to establish the construct validity of VStore in relation to the established computerized cognitive battery, Cogstate, and explore its sensitivity to age-related cognitive decline. Methods: A total of 142 healthy volunteers aged 20-79 years participated in the study. The main VStore outcomes included verbal recall of 12 grocery items, time to collect items, time to select items on a self-checkout machine, time to make the payment, time to order coffee, and total completion time. Construct validity was examined through a series of backward elimination regression models to establish which Cogstate tasks, measuring attention, processing speed, verbal and visual learning, working memory, executive function, and paired associate learning, in addition to age and technological familiarity, best predicted VStore performance. In addition, 2 ridge regression and 2 logistic regression models supplemented with receiver operating characteristic curves were built, with VStore outcomes in the first model and Cogstate outcomes in the second model entered as predictors of age and age cohorts, respectively. Results: Overall VStore performance, as indexed by the total time spent completing the task, was best explained by Cogstate tasks measuring attention, working memory, paired associate learning, and age and technological familiarity, accounting for 47% of the variance. In addition, with λ=5.16, the ridge regression model selected 5 parameters for VStore when predicting age (mean squared error 185.80, SE 19.34), and with λ=9.49 for Cogstate, the model selected all 8 tasks (mean squared error 226.80, SE 23.48). Finally, VStore was found to be highly sensitive (87%) and specific (91.7%) to age cohorts, with 94.6% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that VStore is a promising assessment that engages standard cognitive domains and is sensitive to age-related cognitive decline.},

abstract={AimsNon-invasive measures of brain iron content would be of great benefit in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) to serve as a biomarker for disease progression and evaluation of iron chelation therapy. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides several quantitative measures of brain iron content, none of these have been validated for patients with a severely increased cerebral iron burden. We aimed to validate R2* as a quantitative measure of brain iron content in aceruloplasminemia, the most severely iron-loaded NBIA phenotype.MethodsTissue samples from 50 gray- and white matter regions of a postmortem aceruloplasminemia brain and control subject were scanned at 1.5 T to obtain R2*, and biochemically analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. For gray matter samples of the aceruloplasminemia brain, sample R2* values were compared with postmortem in situ MRI data that had been obtained from the same subject at 3 T – in situ R2*. Relationships between R2* and tissue iron concentration were determined by linear regression analyses.ResultsMedian iron concentrations throughout the whole aceruloplasminemia brain were 10 to 15 times higher than in the control subject, and R2* was linearly associated with iron concentration. For gray matter samples of the aceruloplasminemia subject with an iron concentration up to 1000 mg/kg, 91% of variation in R2* could be explained by iron, and in situ R2* at 3 T and sample R2* at 1.5 T were highly correlated. For white matter regions of the aceruloplasminemia brain, 85% of variation in R2* could be explained by iron.ConclusionsR2* is highly sensitive to variations in iron concentration in the severely iron-loaded brain, and might be used as a non-invasive measure of brain iron content in aceruloplasminemia and potentially other NBIA disorders.},

abstract={SummaryPurposeThe purpose of this study was to develop a novel mouth contactless breathing exercise solution based on virtual reality (VR), and to test its feasibility.MethodsWe developed the Virtual Reality-based Breathing Exercise System (VR-BRES), a self-regulating biofeedback breathing exercise with gaming characteristics and a soft stretch sensor. The feasibility and efficacy of the VR-BRES prototype were investigated through a randomized crossover trial. Fifty healthy adults participated in the trial, and their respiratory parameters and user evaluation of the VR-BRES were compared with conventional deep breathing (CDB) exercises.ResultsThe respiratory parameters, forced vital capacity (Z = 4.82, 4.95, p < .001), forced expiratory volume in one second (t = 6.02, 6.26, p < .001), and peak expiratory flow (t = 5.35, 5.68, p < .001) were significantly higher during breathing exercises using the VR-BRES. User evaluation was also significantly higher for the VR-BRES in terms of efficiency (Z = 3.86, p < .001), entertainingness (Z = 5.00, p < .001), and intention to use (Z = 3.22, p = .001) compared to CDB. However, there was no difference in convenience between the two methods (Z = −0.90, p = .369).ConclusionThe VR-BRES has the potential to be an efficient breathing exercise solution. We recommend a clinical study that evaluates the effects of the VR-BRES for a certain period of time for people who need breathing exercises.},

abstract={Background: Accurately measuring postural sway is an important part of balance assessment and rehabilitation. Although force plates give accurate measurements, their costs and space requirements make their use impractical in many situations. Objective: The work presented in this paper aimed to address this issue by validating a virtual reality (VR) headset as a relatively low-cost alternative to force plates for postural sway measurement. The HTC Vive (HTC Corporation) VR headset has built-in sensors that allow for position and orientation tracking, making it a potentially eﬀective tool for balance assessments. Methods: Participants in this study were asked to stand upright on a force plate (NeuroCom; Natus Medical Incorporated) while wearing the HTC Vive. Position data were collected from the headset and force plate simultaneously as participants experienced a custom-built VR environment that covered their entire field of view. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to examine the test-retest reliability of the postural control variables, which included the normalized path length, root mean square (RMS), and peak-to-peak (P2P) value. These were computed from the VR position output data and the center of pressure (COP) data from the force plate. Linear regression was used to investigate the correlations between the VR and force plate measurements. Results: Our results showed that the test-retest reliability of the RMS and P2P value of VR headset outputs (ICC: range 0.285-0.636) was similar to that of the RMS and P2P value of COP outputs (ICC: range 0.228-0.759). The linear regression between VR and COP measures showed significant correlations in RMSs and P2P values. Conclusions: Based on our results, the VR headset has the potential to be used for postural control measurements. However, the further development of software and testing protocols for balance assessments is needed.},

abstract={Background: In neuropsychology, fully immersive virtual reality (VR) has been spotlighted as a promising tool. It is considered that VR not only overcomes the existing limitation of neuropsychological tests but is also appropriate for treating executive functions (EFs) within activities of daily living (ADL) due to its high ecological validity. While fully immersive VR offers new possibilities of neuropsychological tests, there are few studies that overview the intellectual landscape and academic trends in the research related to mainly targeted EFs with fully immersive VR. Objective: The objective of this study is to get an overview of the research trends that use VR in neuropsychological tests and to analyze the research trends using fully immersive VR neuropsychological tests with experimental articles. Methods: This review was carried out according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles were searched in three web databases using keywords related to VR, EFs, and cognitive abilities. The study was conducted in two steps, keyword analysis and in-depth systematic review. In the web database search from 2000 to 2019, 1167 articles were initially collected, of which 234 articles in the eligibility phase were used to conduct keyword analysis and a total of 47 articles were included for systematic review. Results: In keyword analysis, the number of articles focused on dementia including the keywords “MCI,” “SCD,” and “dementia” were highlighted over the period, rather than other symptoms. In addition, we identified that the use of behavioral and physiological data in virtual environments (VEs) has dramatically increased in recent studies. In the systematic review, we focused on the purpose of study, assessment, treatment, and validation of usability and structure. We found that treatment studies and uncategorized studies including presence and cybersickness issues have emerged in the recent period. In addition, the target symptoms and range of participants were diversified. Conclusions: There has been a continuously increasing interest in dealing with neuropsychology by using fully immersive VR. Target cognitive abilities have been diversified, as well as target symptoms. Moreover, the concept of embodied cognition was transplanted in this research area.},

abstract={PurposeDemonstrate a novel phantom design using a remote camera imaging method capable of concurrently measuring the position of the x‐ray isocenter and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) isocenter on an MR‐linac.MethodsA conical frustum with distinct geometric features was machined out of plastic. The phantom was submerged in a small water tank, and aligned using room lasers on a MRIdian MR‐linac (ViewRay Inc., Cleveland, OH). The phantom physical isocenter was visualized in the MR images and related to the DICOM coordinate isocenter. To view the x‐ray isocenter, an intensified CMOS camera system (DoseOptics LLC., Hanover, NH) was placed at the foot of the treatment couch, and centered such that the optical axis of the camera was coincident with the central axis of the treatment bore. Two or four 8.3mm x 24.1cm beams irradiated the phantom from cardinal directions, producing an optical ring on the conical surface of the phantom. The diameter of the ring, measured at the peak intensity, was compared to the known diameter at the position of irradiation to determine the Z‐direction offset of the beam. A star‐shot method was employed on the front face of the frustum to determine X‐Y alignment of the MV beam. Known shifts were applied to the phantom to establish the sensitivity of the method.ResultsCouch translations, demonstrative of possible isocenter misalignments, on the order of 1mm were detectable for both the radiotherapy and MRI isocenters. Data acquired on the MR‐linac demonstrated an average error of 0.28mm(N=10, R2=0.997, σ=0.37mm) in established Z displacement, and 0.10mm(N=5, σ=0.34mm) in XY directions of the radiotherapy isocenter.ConclusionsThe phantom was capable of measuring both the MRI and radiotherapy treatment isocenters. This method has the potential to be of use in MR‐linac commissioning, and could be streamlined to be valuable in daily constancy checks of isocenter coincidence.},

abstract={Introduction The aim was to validate the dosimetric and geometric accuracy of radiotherapy treatment plans for prostate cancer based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging only and a solution based on computed tomography (CT) supported by MR imaging. Material and methods We used CT and MR images of ten prostate cancer patients implanted with three fiducial markers (FM) in the prostate gland. Rigid registration based on FM was performed to assess the fusion accuracy between MR and CT images. The differences between prostate contours (clinical target volume – CTV) on CT (CTVCT) and MR (CTVMR) images were scored using the Dice similarity coefficient and directly comparing the outlined volumes. The volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were designed and optimised on synthetic CT (sCT) to obtain the dose distribution for the MR-only solution. In the next step, the sCT images were replaced by conventional CT images and the plans were recalculated. The doses obtained on sCT and CT were compared by direct dose subtraction and the gamma method. Results The averaged fiducial registration error was equal to 0.5 mm. All CTVCT volumes were significantly bigger than corresponding CTV delineated on MR images (p = 0.005). The direct dose comparison shows that for 97.1% of patients’ bodies, the differences were smaller than 0.1%. The average gamma passing rates were higher than 0.970. Conclusions MR imaging allows for a more precise delineation of the prostate compared to CT imaging. The workflow of plan preparation based on MR and CT is burdened with an FM registration error that is eliminated by an MR-only solution with no compromise on dose distribution.},

abstract={Background It has been noted in the literature that there is a gap between clinical assessment and real-world performance. Real-world conversations entail visual and audio information, yet there are not any audiological assessment tools that include visual information. Virtual reality (VR) technology has been applied to various areas, including audiology. However, the use of VR in speech-in-noise perception has not yet been investigated. Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of virtual space (VS) on speech performance and its feasibility to be used as a speech test instrument. We hypothesized that individuals’ ability to recognize speech would improve when visual cues were provided. Methods A total of 30 individuals with normal hearing and 25 individuals with hearing loss completed pure-tone audiometry and the Korean version of the Hearing in Noise Test (K-HINT) under three conditions—conventional K-HINT (cK-HINT), VS on PC (VSPC), and VS head-mounted display (VSHMD)—at –10 dB, –5 dB, 0 dB, and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Participants listened to target speech and repeated it back to the tester for all conditions. Hearing aid users in the hearing loss group completed testing under unaided and aided conditions. A questionnaire was administered after testing to gather subjective opinions on the headset, the VSHMD condition, and test preference. Results Provision of visual information had a significant impact on speech performance between the normal hearing and hearing impaired groups. The Mann-Whitney U test showed statistical significance ( P Conclusions Findings are in line with previous literature that showed that visual cues were beneficial for communication. This is the first study to include hearing aid users with a more naturalistic stimulus and a relatively simple test environment, suggesting the feasibility of VR audiological testing in clinical practice.},

abstract={ObjectiveTest a practical realignment approach to compensate the technical variability of MR radiomic features.MethodsT1 phantom images acquired on 2 scanners, FLAIR and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) images of 18 brain tumor patients scanned on both 1.5-T and 3-T scanners, and 36 T2-weighted (T2w) images of prostate cancer patients scanned in one of two centers were investigated. The ComBat procedure was used for harmonizing radiomic features. Differences in statistical distributions in feature values between 1.5- and 3-T images were tested before and after harmonization. The prostate studies were used to determine the impact of harmonization to distinguish between Gleason grades (GGs).ResultsIn the phantom data, 40 out of 42 radiomic feature values were significantly different between the 2 scanners before harmonization and none after. In white matter regions, the statistical distributions of features were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the 1.5- and 3-T images for 37 out of 42 features in both FLAIR and CE-T1w images. After harmonization, no statistically significant differences were observed. In brain tumors, 41 (FLAIR) or 36 (CE-T1w) out of 42 features were significantly different between the 1.5- and 3-T images without harmonization, against 1 (FLAIR) or none (CE-T1w) with harmonization. In prostate studies, 636 radiomic features were significantly different between GGs after harmonization against 461 before. The ability to distinguish between GGs using radiomic features was increased after harmonization.ConclusionComBat harmonization efficiently removes inter-center technical inconsistencies in radiomic feature values and increases the sensitivity of studies using data from several scanners.Key Points• Radiomic feature values obtained using different MR scanners or imaging protocols can be harmonized by combining off-the-shelf image standardization and feature realignment procedures.• Harmonized radiomic features enable one to pool data from different scanners and centers without a substantial loss of statistical power caused by intra- and inter-center variability.• The proposed realignment method is applicable to radiomic features from different MR sequences and tumor types and does not rely on any phantom acquisition.},

abstract={Most surgical simulators leverage virtual or bench models to simulate reality. This study proposes and validates a method for workspace configuration of a surgical simulator which utilizes a haptic device for interaction with a virtual model and a bench model to provide additional tactile feedback based on planned surgical manoeuvers. Numerical analyses were completed to determine the workspace and position of a haptic device, relative to the bench model, used in the surgical simulator, and the determined configuration was validated using device limitations and user data from surgical and nonsurgical users. For the validation, surgeons performed an identical surgery on a cadaver prior to using the simulator, and their trajectories were then compared to the determined workspace for the haptic device. The configuration of the simulator was determined appropriate through workspace analysis and the collected user trajectories. Statistical analyses suggest differences in trajectories between the participating surgeons which were not affected by the imposed haptic workspace. This study, therefore, demonstrates a method to optimally position a haptic device with respect to a bench model while meeting the manoeuverability needs of a surgical procedure. The validation method identified workspace position and user trajectory towards ideal configuration of a mixed reality simulator.},

abstract={Aiming at the problem of low diagnosis efficiency and accuracy, due to noise and cross aliasing among various faults when diagnosing composite faults of rolling bearing under actual working conditions, a composite fault diagnosis method of rolling bearing based on optimized wavelet packet autoregressive (AR) spectral energy entropy and adaptive no velocity term particle swarm optimization-self organizing map-back propagation neural network (ANVTPSO-SOM-BPNN) is proposed. The energy entropy feature is extracted from the bearing vibration signal through wavelet packet AR spectrum, and SOM and BPNN are combined to form a series network. For PSO, the velocity term is discarded and the inertia weight and learning factor are adaptively adjusted. Finally, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence fusion diagnosis is carried out. To get closer to the application condition, the data are collected near and far away from the fault point for the composite fault diagnosis, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignant cancer and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among men worldwide. There is still an urgent need for biomarkers applicable for diagnosis, prognosis, therapy prediction, or therapy monitoring in PCa. Liquid biopsies, including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), are a valuable source for studying such biomarkers and are minimally invasive. In our study, we investigated the cfDNA of 34 progressive PCa patients, via targeted sequencing, for sequence variants and for the occurrence of CTCs, with a focus on androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7)-positive CTCs. The cfDNA content was associated with overall survival (OS; p = 0.014), disease-specific survival (DSS; p = 0.004), and time to treatment change (TTC; p = 0.001). Moreover, when considering all sequence variants grouped by their functional impact and allele frequency, a significant association with TTC (p = 0.017) was observed. When investigating only pathogenic or likely pathogenic gene variants, variants of the BRCA1 gene (p = 0.029) and the AR ligand-binding domain (p = 0.050) were associated with a shorter TTC. Likewise, the presence of CTCs was associated with a shorter TTC (p = 0.031). The presence of AR-V7-positive CTCs was associated with TTC (p < 0.001) in Kaplan–Meier analysis. Interestingly, all patients with AR-V7-positive CTCs also carried TP53 point mutations. Altogether, analysis of cfDNA and CTCs can provide complementary information that may support temporal and targeted treatment decisions and may elucidate the optimal choice within the variety of therapy options for advanced PCa patients.},

abstract={Simple SummaryHyperthermia treatments where tumor tissue is heated to 40–44 °C for 60–90 min can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. To solve this need, we have designed an MR compatible head and neck hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we experimentally validated the design, heating capabilities and the MR compatibility of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas efficiently transfer the power and have low interaction between the antenna elements. The heating and focusing capabilities satisfy the requirements. The MRcollar can operate in an MR scanner and it can acquire higher quality MR images due to the built in receiver elements. The MRcollar has great potential to improve hyperthermia treatment in the head and neck region and it is now ready for in vivo studies.AbstractClinical effectiveness of hyperthermia treatments, in which tumor tissue is artificially heated to 40–44 °C for 60–90 min, can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. The need for noninvasive temperature monitoring in the head and neck region (H&N) and the potential of MR thermometry prompt us to design an MR compatible hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we validate the design, numerical model, and MR performance of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas have low reflection coefficients (<−15 dB) and the intended low interaction between the individual antenna modules (<−32 dB). A 10 °C increase in 3 min was reached in a muscle-equivalent phantom, such that the specifications from the European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology were easily reached. The MRcollar had a minimal effect on MR image quality and a five-fold improvement in SNR was achieved using the integrated coils of the MRcollar, compared to the body coil. The feasibility of using the MRcollar in an MR environment was shown by a synchronous heating experiment. The match between the predicted SAR and measured SAR using MR thermometry satisfied the gamma criteria distance-to-agreement = 5 mm, dose-difference = 7%]. All experiments combined show that the MRcollar delivers on the needs for MR—hyperthermia in the H&N and is ready for in vivo investigation.},

abstract={(1) COVID-19 pandemic restrictions caused a dramatic shift in research activities, forcing the adoption of remote practices and methods. Despite the known benefits of remote testing, there is limited knowledge on how to prepare and conduct such studies in the industrial context where the target users are experts and company employees. (2) In this article, we detail how we organized VR user tests in five industrial cases during the pandemic, focusing on practicalities and procedures. We cover both on-site testing, including disinfecting and other safety protocols, as well as remote and hybrid setups where both remote and on-site participants were involved. Subject matter experts from eight countries were involved in a total of 22 tests. (3) We share insights for VR user test arrangements relevant to the pandemic, remote and hybrid setups, and an industrial context, among others. (4) Our work confirms that with careful planning it is possible to organize user tests remotely. There are also some limitations in remote user testing, such as reduced visibility and interaction with participants. Most importantly, we list practical recommendations for organizing hybrid user tests with safety and disinfecting procedures for on-site VR use.},

abstract={Featured ApplicationAircraft Shock Absorber with Controllable Damping Force.AbstractThis work presents a novel design model of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based shock absorber (MR shock absorber in short) that can be applied to an aircraft landing gear system. When an external force acts on an MR shock absorber, pressure loss occurs at the flow path while resisting the fluid flow. During the flow motion, two pressure losses occur: the major loss, which is proportional to the flow rate, and the minor loss, which is proportional to the square of the flow rate. In general, when an MR shock absorber is designed for low stroke velocity systems such as an automotive suspension system, the consideration of the major loss only for the design model is well satisfied by experimental results. However, when an MR shock absorber is applied to dynamic systems that require high stroke velocity, such as aircraft landing gear systems, the minor loss effect becomes significant to the pressure drop. In this work, a new design model for an MR shock absorber, considering both the major and minor pressure losses, is proposed. After formulating a mathematical design model, a prototype of an MR shock absorber is manufactured based on the design parameters of a lightweight aircraft landing gear system. After establishing a drop test for the MR shock absorber, the results of the pressure drop versus stroke/stroke velocity are investigated at different impact energies. It is shown from comparative evaluation that the proposed design model agrees with the experiment much better than the model that considers only the major pressure loss.},

abstract={The three types of presentations of ADHD often co-occur with other disorders, anxiety being one of the most prevalent. For this reason and because there are few studies that have examined the influence of anxiety on attentional activities, this study aims to determine how internalizing difficulties (anxiety levels) can influence performance in a virtual reality continuous performance test. The study used a non-probabilistic clinical sample comprising 68 boys (66%) and 35 girls (34%) aged between 6 and 16 (M = 12.24; SD = 2.45) who had been referred to clinical services for the evaluation of ADHD symptoms. Once informed consent was given, the children were administered the STAI-C scale and a virtual reality continuous performance test by expert researchers. Hierarchical regression models showed that only state anxiety demonstrated significant explanatory power over attentional variables. These findings confirm how important it is for children to feel relaxed when they undergo psychological evaluation tests, as otherwise the individual’s intervention design would be based on biased data. Similarly, the findings also suggested an effect of IQ in the interpretation of continuous performance scores.},

abstract={The different pathways between the position of a near-infrared camera and the user’s eye limit the use of existing near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems for tumor margin assessments. By utilizing an optical system that precisely matches the near-infrared fluorescence image and the optical path of visible light, we developed an augmented reality (AR)-based fluorescence imaging system that provides users with a fluorescence image that matches the real-field, without requiring any additional algorithms. Commercial smart glasses, dichroic beam splitters, mirrors, and custom near-infrared cameras were employed to develop the proposed system, and each mount was designed and utilized. After its performance was assessed in the laboratory, preclinical experiments involving tumor detection and lung lobectomy in mice and rabbits by using indocyanine green (ICG) were conducted. The results showed that the proposed system provided a stable image of fluorescence that matched the actual site. In addition, preclinical experiments confirmed that the proposed system could be used to detect tumors using ICG and evaluate lung lobectomies. The AR-based intraoperative smart goggle system could detect fluorescence images for tumor margin assessments in animal models, without disrupting the surgical workflow in an operating room. Additionally, it was confirmed that, even when the system itself was distorted when worn, the fluorescence image consistently matched the actual site.},

abstract={Background: Although various technologies are used to evaluate driving skill, there are some limitations such as the limited range of the monitor and the possible risk of causing cybersickness. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in the hazard perception and cybersickness experienced between novice and experienced drivers measured in a VR hazard perception test with a head-mounted display (HMD). Methods: The novice (n = 32) and the experienced drivers (n = 36) participated in the hazard perception test through the VR of an HMD. Results: The total number of identified hazards was 1071 in the novice drivers and 1376 in the experienced drivers. Two of the hazards appeared to be only identifiable through the HMD. A chi-square test revealed that experienced drivers were more likely to identify the hazards than the novice drivers (p 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the VR hazard perception test may be useful for evaluating patients’ driving skills.},

abstract={Subjective visual vertical (SVV) and subjective visual horizontal (SVH) tests can be used to evaluate the perception of verticality and horizontality, respectively, and can aid the diagnosis of otolith dysfunction in clinical practice. In this study, SVV and SVH screen version tests are implemented using virtual reality (VR) equipment; the proposed test method promotes a more immersive feeling for the subject while using a simple equipment configuration and possessing excellent mobility. To verify the performance of the proposed VR-based SVV and SVH tests, a reliable comparison was made between the traditional screen-based SVV and SVH tests and the proposed method, based on 30 healthy subjects. The average results of our experimental tests on the VR-based binocular SVV and SVH equipment were −0.15° ± 1.74 and 0.60° ± 1.18, respectively. The proposed VR-based method satisfies the normal tolerance for horizontal or vertical lines, i.e., a ±3° error, as defined in previous studies, and it can be used to replace existing test methods.},

VR is considered to be the gold standard for attention distraction, but it cannot be used in certain clinical cases or for particular medical procedures. A repeatedmeasures experimental study was carried out with 42 participants using tactile and VR variants of an n-back task and a cold pressor test for pain. The independent variable was the distraction type (tactile, VR, or no-distraction) and the dependent variable was pain tolerance (i.e., time participants kept their hand in cold water). The results showed that both tactile and VR games effectively increased pain tolerance compared to the control condition. Effect sizes for both interventions were similar. However, the effect was observed only for female participants.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether distraction (lack of attentional focus) and attention (cognitive load) are differentially involved in the analgesic effect of virtual reality (VR) immersions during a cold pressor test (CPT). Methods: Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (high and low cognitive load, attention with or without a reminder of the pain stimuli) and performed three CPTs. Pain was assessed based on the duration of the CPT (pain tolerance), a visual analog rating scale of perceived pain intensity during the CPT and the subjective pain scale of the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Results: The statistical analyses revealed that VR immersions were associated with less pain compared to the baseline (all p < 0.001), but for the experimental manipulations, only the conditions where there was an increase in cognitive load (ie, from low cognitive load at Immersion 1 to high cognitive load at Immersion 2) were effective for increasing pain tolerance (significant Time X Conditions interaction). The interactions were not significant for pain intensity assessed with the VAS or the SF-MPQ. Conclusion: The results suggest that increases in cognitive load play an important role in the analgesic effect of VR immersion, although the combination of attentional focus and cognitive load may be important. Suggestions are given for designing a replication study.},

abstract={Discordant biotite 40Ar/39Ar age spectra are commonly reported in the literature. These can be caused by a number of processes related to in vacuo heating, homogenization of the argon distribution, and production of misleadingly flat age spectra. Problematic samples are typically derived from metamorphic belts; thermal overprinting and chloritization are two of the main known causes of disturbed age spectra. Biotite and muscovite of the Waziyü detachment fault, Yiwulüshan metamorphic core complex, Jinzhou, China, yield highly variable 40Ar/39Ar data that hinder reconstruction of their deformation history. We combined mineralogical studies with detailed 40Ar/39Ar dating of biotite, phengitic white mica, and K-feldspar augen from this fault. We infer that argon within the biotite was modified by hydrothermal fluids during fault activity and associated epidotization, chloritization, and muscovitization such that bulk sample step-heating, single grain total fusion, and in situ laser ablation of biotite produced mixed 40Ar/39Ar ages. However, detailed step-heating of biotite shows that this mineral records the ages of cooling and later alteration based on data from a coexisting rigid feldspar porphyroblast and neo-crystallized phengite that record two periods of fault activity at ~120–113 and 18–12 Ma. Our data reveal that the discordant biotite 40Ar/39Ar age spectra might represent a mixed age and that only detailed step-heating methods can extract meaningful geological details of the deformation history of a fault. Therefore, the mineral and the method must be carefully considered if metamorphic or deformed samples are dated.},

abstract={Background Technological advances provide an opportunity to refine tools that assess central nervous system performance. This study aimed to assess the test-retest reliability and convergent and ecological validity of a newly developed, virtual-reality, concussion assessment tool, ‘CONVIRT’, which uses eye-tracking technology to assess visual processing speed, and manual reaction time (pushing a button on a riding crop) to assess attention and decision-making. CONVIRT was developed for horse jockeys, as of all sportspersons, they are most at risk of concussion. Methods Participants (N = 165), were assessed with CONVIRT, which uses virtual reality to give the user the experience of riding a horse during a horserace. Participants were also assessed with standard Cogstate computer-based concussion measures in-between two completions of the CONVIRT battery. The physiological arousal induced by the test batteries were assessed via measures of heart rate and heart rate variability (LF/HF ratio). Results Satisfactory test-retest reliability and convergent validity with Cogstate attention and decision-making subtests and divergent validity in visual processing speed measures were observed. CONVIRT also increased heart rate and LF/HF ratio, which may better approximate participant arousal levels in their workplace. Conclusions CONVIRT may be a reliable and valid tool to assess elements of cognition and CNS disruption. The increased ecological validity may also mean better informed ‘return-to-play’ decisions and stronger industry acceptance due to the real-world meaningfulness of the assessment. However, before this can be achieved, the sensitivity of the CONVIRT battery needs to be demonstrated.},

abstract={In recent decades, gaming technology has been accepted as a feasible method for complementing traditional clinical practice, especially in neurorehabilitation; however, the viability of using 3D Virtual Reality (VR) for the assessment of upper limb motor function has not been fully explored. For that purpose, we developed a VR-based version of the Box and Blocks Test (BBT), a clinical test for the assessment of manual dexterity, as an automated alternative to the classical procedure. Our VR-based BBT (VR-BBT) integrates the traditional BBT mechanics into gameplay using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) to capture the user’s hand motion and the Oculus Rift headset to provide a fully immersive experience. This paper focuses on evaluating the validity of our VR-BBT to reliably measure the manual dexterity in a sample of patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). For this study, a group of twenty individuals in a mild to moderate stage of PD were recruited. Participants were asked to perform the physical BBT (once) and our proposed VR-BBT (twice) system, separately. Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the VR-BBT significantly correlated with the conventional assessment of the BBT. The VR-BBT scores have shown a significant association with PD severity measured by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. This fact suggests that the VR-BBT could be used as a reliable indicator for health improvements in patients with PD. Finally, the VR-BBT system presented high usability and acceptability rated by clinicians and patients.},

abstract={PurposeThe magnetic field can cause a nonnegligible dosimetric effect in an MR‐Linac system. This effect should be accurately accounted for by the beam models in treatment planning systems (TPS). The purpose of the study was to verify the beam model and the entire treatment planning and delivery process for a 1.5 T MR‐Linac based on comprehensive dosimetric measurements and end‐to‐end tests.Material and methodsDosimetry measurements and end‐to‐end tests were performed on a preclinical MR‐Linac (Elekta AB) using a multitude of detectors and were compared to the corresponding beam model calculations from the TPS for the MR‐Linac. Measurement devices included ion chambers (IC), diamond detector, radiochromic film, and MR‐compatible ion chamber array and diode array. The dose in inhomogeneous phantom was also verified. The end‐to‐end tests include the generation, delivery, and comparison of 3D and IMRT plan with measurement.ResultsFor the depth dose measurements with Farmer IC, micro IC and diamond detector, the absolute difference between most measurement points and beam model calculation beyond the buildup region were <1%, at most 2% for a few measurement points. For the beam profile measurements, the absolute differences were no more than 1% outside the penumbra region and no more than 2.5% inside the penumbra region. Results of end‐to‐end tests demonstrated that three 3D static plans with single 5 × 10 cm2 fields (at gantry angle 0°, 90° and 270°) and two IMRT plans successfully passed gamma analysis with clinical criteria. The dose difference in the inhomogeneous phantom between the calculation and measurement was within 1.0%.ConclusionsBoth relative and absolute dosimetry measurements agreed well with the TPS calculation, indicating that the beam model for MR‐Linac properly accounts for the magnetic field effect. The end‐to‐end tests verified the entire treatment planning process.},

abstract={ObjectivesWhole-body MR imaging is increasingly utilised; although for lung dedicated sequences are often not included, the chest is typically imaged. Our objective was to determine the clinical utility of lung volumes derived from non-dedicated MRI sequences in the population-based KORA-FF4 cohort study.Methods400 subjects (56.4 ± 9.2 years, 57.6% males) underwent whole-body MRI including a coronal T1-DIXON-VIBE sequence in inspiration breath-hold, originally acquired for fat quantification. Based on MRI, lung volumes were derived using an automated framework and related to common predictors, pulmonary function tests (PFT; spirometry and pulmonary gas exchange, n = 214) and obstructive lung disease.ResultsMRI-based lung volume was 4.0 ± 1.1 L, which was 64.8 ± 14.9% of predicted total lung capacity (TLC) and 124.4 ± 27.9% of functional residual capacity. In multivariate analysis, it was positively associated with age, male, current smoking and height. Among PFT indices, MRI-based lung volume correlated best with TLC, alveolar volume and residual volume (RV; r = 0.57 each), while it was negatively correlated to FEV1/FVC (r = 0.36) and transfer factor for carbon monoxide (r = 0.16). Combining the strongest PFT parameters, RV and FEV1/FVC remained independently and incrementally associated with MRI-based lung volume (β = 0.50, p = 0.04 and β = – 0.02, p = 0.02, respectively) explaining 32% of the variability. For the identification of subjects with obstructive lung disease, height-indexed MRI-based lung volume yielded an AUC of 0.673–0.654.ConclusionLung volume derived from non-dedicated whole-body MRI is independently associated with RV and FEV1/FVC. Furthermore, its moderate accuracy for obstructive lung disease indicates that it may be a promising tool to assess pulmonary health in whole-body imaging when PFT is not available.Key Points• Although whole-body MRI often does not include dedicated lung sequences, lung volume can be automatically derived using dedicated segmentation algorithms• Lung volume derived from whole-body MRI correlates with typical predictors and risk factors of respiratory function including smoking and represents about 65% of total lung capacity and 125% of the functional residual capacity• Lung volume derived from whole-body MRI is independently associated with residual volume and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity and may allow detection of obstructive lung disease},

abstract={PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess test–retest reliability, agreement, and responsiveness of questionnaires on productivity loss (iPCQ-VR) and healthcare utilization (TiCP-VR) for sick-listed workers with chronic musculoskeletal pain who were referred to vocational rehabilitation. Methods Test–retest reliability and agreement was assessed with a 2-week interval. Responsiveness was assessed at discharge after a 15-week vocational rehabilitation (VR) program. Data was obtained from six Dutch VR centers. Test–retest reliability was determined with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen’s kappa. Agreement was determined by Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), smallest detectable changes (on group and individual level), and percentage observed, positive and negative agreement. Responsiveness was determined with area under the curve (AUC) obtained from receiver operation characteristic (ROC). Results A sample of 52 participants on test–retest reliability and agreement, and a sample of 223 on responsiveness were included in the analysis. Productivity loss (iPCQ-VR): ICCs ranged from 0.52 to 0.90, kappa ranged from 0.42 to 0.96, and AUC ranged from 0.55 to 0.86. Healthcare utilization (TiCP-VR): ICC was 0.81, and kappa values of the single healthcare utilization items ranged from 0.11 to 1.00. Conclusions The iPCQ-VR showed good measurement properties on working status, number of hours working per week and long-term sick leave, and low measurement properties on short-term sick leave and presenteeism. The TiCP-VR showed adequate reliability on all healthcare utilization items together and medication use, but showed low measurement properties on the single healthcare utilization items.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to validate quantitative performance of a newly released simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, by using MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC), both in phantom study and in patient study. PET/MRI image uniformities of a phantom under different hardware configurations were tested and compared. Thirty patients were examined with 2-deoxy-2-18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) and subsequent PET/MRI. PET images from PET/MRI were corrected with MRAC (PETMR), CT-based attenuation maps (μ-maps, PETCT), and segmented CT μ-maps (PETCTSeg) derived from PET/CT. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were compared among the 3 sets of PET in main organs (bone, liver and lung) and in 52 FDG-avid lesions, including soft-tissue lesions and bone lesions. The result showed that PET imaging uniformities of PET/MRI under different configurations were good (<8.8%). The SUV differences among the 3 sets of PET varied with organs and lesion types. In detail, the mean relative differences of SUV between PETMR and PETCT were as follows: −18.8%, bone (SUVmean); −8.0%, liver (SUVmean); −12.2%, lung (SUVmean); −18.1%, bone lesions (SUVmean); −13.3%, bone lesions (SUVmax); −8.2%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmean); and −7.3%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmax). The mean relative differences between PETMR and PETCTSeg were as follows: −19.0%, bone (SUVmean); −3.5%, liver (SUVmean); −3.3%, lung (SUVmean); −19.3%, bone lesions (SUVmean); −17.5%, bone lesions (SUVmax); −5.5%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmean); and −4.4%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmax). The differences of SUV between PETMR and PETCT were larger than those between PETMR and PETCTSeg, in both soft tissue and soft-tissue lesions (P<0.001), but not in bone or bone lesions. In conclusion, MRAC in the newly released PET/MR system is accurate in most tissues, with SUV deviations being generally less than 10%, compared to PET/CT. In bone, however, underestimations can be substantial, which may be partially attributed to segmentation of the MR-based μ-maps.},

abstract={PurposeCardiac PET-MR has shown potential for the comprehensive assessment of coronary heart disease. However, image degradation due to physiological motion remains a challenge that could hinder the adoption of this technology in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to validate a recently proposed respiratory motion-corrected PET-MR framework for the simultaneous visualisation of myocardial viability (18F-FDG PET) and coronary artery anatomy (coronary MR angiography, CMRA) in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO).MethodsA cohort of 14 patients was scanned with the proposed PET-CMRA framework. PET and CMRA images were reconstructed with and without the proposed motion correction approach for comparison purposes. Metrics of image quality including visible vessel length and sharpness were obtained for CMRA for both the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries (RCA, LAD), and relative increase in 18F-FDG PET signal after motion correction for standard 17-segment polar maps was computed. Resulting coronary anatomy by CMRA and myocardial integrity by PET were visually compared against X-ray angiography and conventional Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI, respectively.ResultsMotion correction increased CMRA visible vessel length by 49.9% and 32.6% (RCA, LAD) and vessel sharpness by 12.3% and 18.9% (RCA, LAD) on average compared to uncorrected images. Coronary lumen delineation on motion-corrected CMRA images was in good agreement with X-ray angiography findings. For PET, motion correction resulted in an average 8% increase in 18F-FDG signal in the inferior and inferolateral segments of the myocardial wall. An improved delineation of myocardial viability defects and reduced noise in the 18F-FDG PET images was observed, improving correspondence to subendocardial LGE-MRI findings compared to uncorrected images.ConclusionThe feasibility of the PET-CMRA framework for simultaneous cardiac PET-MR imaging in a short and predictable scan time (~11 min) has been demonstrated in 14 patients with CTO. Motion correction increased visible length and sharpness of the coronary arteries by CMRA, and improved delineation of the myocardium by 18F-FDG PET, resulting in good agreement with X-ray angiography and LGE-MRI.},

abstract={Background/Objective: Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) have demonstrated validity when differentiating children with ADHD from healthy controls. However, these CPTs have limitations such as low ecological validity. New CPTs based on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) have appeared as supposedly improved methods for assessing ADHD. This study aims to compare the discriminant value of attentional variables produced by a VR CPT (Aula Nesplora) with that of variables from a traditional CPT (Test of Variables of Attention; TOVA) for identifying ADHD. Method: A total of 338 children aged between 6 and 16 years old (M = 10.84, SD = 3.01) participated in the study: 31.95% correspond to the inattentive presentation, 15.38% to the impulsive-hyperactive presentation, 22.78% to the combined presentation, and the remaining 29.88% correspond to children without ADHD. Results: Results indicated that Aula Nesplora predicts ADHD presentations better than TOVA. It also differentiates better between ADHD and non-ADHD students. Conclusions: These findings show the potential advantages of using virtual reality in ADHD assessment, as it facilitates the diagnosis of ADHD and the differentiation of its presentations in a realistic environment.Alternate abstract:Antecedentes/objetivos: Los tests de ejecución continua (Continuous Perfomance Test; CPT) han mostrado utilidad en la diferenciación de los ninos con TDAH de los controles.

abstract={Background: Sørensen trunk extension endurance test performance predicts the development of low back pain and is a strong discriminator of those with and without low back pain. Performance may greatly depend on psychological factors, such as kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, and motivation. Virtual reality video games have been used in people with low back pain to encourage physical activity that would otherwise be avoided out of fear of pain or harm. Accordingly, we developed a virtual reality video game to assess the influence of immersive gaming on the Sørensen test performance. Objective: The objective of our study was to determine the physiological and psychological predictors of time to task failure (TTF) on a virtual reality Sørensen test in participants with and without a history of recurrent low back pain. Methods: We recruited 24 individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain and 24 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched individuals without a history of low back pain. Participants completed a series of psychological measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pain Resilience Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and a self-efficacy measure. The maximal isometric strength of trunk and hip extensors and TTF on a virtual reality Sørensen test were measured. Electromyography of the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris was recorded during the strength and endurance trials. Results: A two-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in TTF between groups (P=.99), but there was a trend for longer TTF in females on the virtual reality Sørensen test (P=.06). Linear regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of TTF in each group. In healthy participants, the normalized median power frequency slope of erector spinae (beta=.450, P=.01), biceps femoris (beta=.400, P=.01), and trunk mass (beta=−.32, P=.02) predicted TTF. In participants with recurrent low back pain, trunk mass (beta=−.67, P<.001), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (beta=−.43, P=.01), and self-efficacy (beta=.35, P=.03) predicted TTF. Conclusions: Trunk mass appears to be a consistent predictor of performance. Kinesiophobia appears to negatively influence TTF for those with a history of recurrent low back pain, but does not influence healthy individuals. Self-efficacy is associated with better performance in individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain, whereas a less steep median power frequency slope of the trunk and hip extensors is associated with better performance in individuals without a history of low back pain.},

abstract={Introduction Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) is a promising non-invasive imaging tool in viability and cardiomyopathy, quantifying infarct size more accurately than late-gadolinium enhancement, as we previously demonstrated. We aimed to validate MEMRI viability against 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET). Methods Sprague-Dawley rats (male; 180-300 g) underwent permanent surgical anterior myocardial infarction (n=11), or sham surgery (n=2), with dual MEMRI and 18F-FDG PET assessment at 12 weeks. MEMRI (7 T spectrometer, Agilent, UK) was achieved with intravenous manganese gluconate (EVP1001-1, Eagle-Vision-Pharmaceuticals, USA; n=6, 22 μmol/kg) and mangafodipir (Teslascan, IC-Targets, Norway; n=7, 44 μmol/kg). Anatomical and functional imaging preceded cardiac-gated Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MoLLI) before and 20 min post-contrast (at maximal infarct slice). Commercially available software generated standardised T1 maps for ROI-contouring. For PET imaging, intravenous 18F-FDG (20-30 MBq) was administered with PET data acquired for 60 min, followed by cardiac-gated acquisition (10 min). PET/MR images were co-registered and fused for analysis. Results Infarct size assessed by MEMRI T1 mapping was smaller than by native T1 at 12 weeks (mean 23.34 vs 18.68%; p=0.001). Native T1 mapping consistently overestimated infarct size (bias 25.76; 95% CI: 7.51 to 44.01; p=0.031) but there was excellent agreement between MEMRI T1 mapping and 18F-FDG (bias 1.30; 95% CI: -24.98 to 25.57; p=0.7). Post-MEMRI T1 values showed negative trend with increasing SUV (r2=0.25, p=0.08) whereas native T1 demonstrated no relationship (r2=0.0001, p>0.9). Conclusion MEMRI T1 mapping identifies viable myocardium as well as 18F-FDG PET and was superior to native T1 mapping. Post-MEMRI T1 appears related to SUV where native T1 does not. This validation data informs the clinical translation of cardiac MEMRI.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of positron emission tomography (PET) component of PET/computed tomography (CT) with new emerging PET/magnetic resonance (MR) of the same vendor. According to National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU2-07, five separate experimental tests were performed to evaluate the performance of PET scanner of General Electric GE company; SIGNATM model PET/MR and GE Discovery 710 model PET/CT. The main investigated aspects were spatial resolution, sensitivity, scatter fraction, count rate performance, image quality, count loss and random events correction accuracy. The findings of this study demonstrated superior sensitivity (~ 4 folds) of PET scanner in PET/MR compared to PET/CT system. Image quality test exhibited higher contrast in PET/MR (~ 9%) compared with PET/CT. The scatter fraction of PET/MR was 43.4% at noise equivalent count rate (NECR) peak of 218 kcps and the corresponding activity concentration was 17.7 kBq/cc. Whereas the scatter fraction of PET/CT was found as 39.2% at NECR peak of 72 kcps and activity concentration of 24.3 kBq/cc. The percentage error of the random event correction accuracy was 3.4% and 3.1% in PET/MR and PET/CT, respectively. It was concluded that PET/MR system is about 4 times more sensitive than PET/CT, and the contrast of hot lesions in PET/MR was ~ 9% higher than PET/CT. These outcomes also emphasize the possibility to achieve excellent clinical PET images with low administered dose and/or a short acquisition time in PET/MR.Alternate abstract:Bu çalışmada son yıllarda nükleer tıpta rutin uygulamaya giren pozitron emisyon tomografisi/manyetik rezonans (PET/ MR) görüntüleme sistemi ile PET/bilgisayarlı tomografi (BT) görüntüleme sistemlerinde 'National Electrical Manufacturers Association' (NEMA) testlerinin yapılması ve sonuçların karşılaştırılması amaçlandı.

abstract={Purpose The aim of this study was to translate and validate an Arabic version of the 5-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP). Methods A total of 320 subjects (aged 18 years and above) were consecutively recruited from dental clinics. The self-administered OHIP5-Ar was distributed and the data were collected and analyzed. The dimensionality of the instrument was investigated using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Reliability was assessed as the instruments internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest-reliability using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent validity was tested by correlation between perceived global oral and general health questions with the latent factor (OHRQoL) using structural equation modelling analysis and with OHIP5-Ar total score using spearman’s correlation coefficient. Known-groups validity was tested among groups with known differences and sensitivity to change was also investigated after dental treatments. Results The OHIP5-Ar was fitted well in the unidimensional model as indicated by the CFA with fit indices (RMSEA: 0.00, SRMR: 0.010, GFI: 0.998, TLI: 1). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.78 and the ICC agreement was 0.88. The validity tests indicated satisfactory validity of the instrument and the sensitivity to change of the instrument revealed significant change in the OHIP5-Ar total score after the provision of dental treatments (effect sizes: 0.55–1.49). Conclusion The OHIP5-Ar showed satisfactory psychometric properties among Arabic-speaking population. This instrument is sensitive to the changes of oral health and can be used to measure the OHRQoL with one total score.},

abstract={Better understanding of agglomeration behavior of nonmetallic inclusions in the steelmaking process is important to control the cleanliness of the steel. In this work, a revision on the Paunov simplified model has been made according to the original Kralchevsky-Paunov model. Thus, this model has been applied to quantitatively calculate the attractive capillary force on inclusions agglomerating at the liquid steel/gas interface. Moreover, the agglomeration behavior of Al2O3 inclusions at a low carbon steel/Ar interface has been observed in situ by high-temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The velocity and acceleration of inclusions and attractive forces between Al2O3 inclusions of various sizes were calculated based on the CLSM video. The results calculated using the revised model offered a reasonable fit with the present experimental data for different inclusion sizes. Moreover, a quantitative comparison was made between calculations using the equivalent radius of a circle and those using the effective radius. It was found that the calculated capillary force using equivalent radius offered a better fit with the present experimental data because of the inclusion characteristics. Comparing these results with other studies in the literature allowed the authors to conclude that when applied in capillary force calculations, the equivalent radius is more suitable for inclusions with large size and irregular shape, and the effective radius is more appropriate for inclusions with small size or a large shape factor. Using this model, the effect of inclusion size on attractive capillary force has been investigated, demonstrating that larger inclusions are more strongly attracted.},

abstract={Purpose To assess the construct and face validity of ArthroS, a passive haptic VR simulator. A secondary aim was to evaluate the novel performance metrics produced by this simulator. Methods Two groups of 30 participants, each divided into novice, intermediate or expert based on arthroscopic experience, completed three separate tasks on either the knee or shoulder module of the simulator. Performance was recorded using 12 automatically generated performance metrics and video footage of the arthroscopic procedures. The videos were blindly assessed using a validated global rating scale (GRS). Participants completed a survey about the simulator's realism and training utility. Results This new simulator demonstrated construct validity of its tasks when evaluated against a GRS (p less than or equal to] 0.003 in all cases). Regarding it's automatically generated performance metrics, established outputs such as time taken (p less than or equal to] 0.001) and instrument path length (p less than or equal to] 0.007) also demonstrated good construct validity. However, two-thirds of the proposed 'novel metrics' the simulator reports could not distinguish participants based on arthroscopic experience. Face validity assessment rated the simulator as a realistic and useful tool for trainees, but the passive haptic feedback (a key feature of this simulator) is rated as less realistic. Conclusion The ArthroS simulator has good task construct validity based on established objective outputs, but some of the novel performance metrics could not distinguish between surgical experience. The passive haptic feedback of the simulator also needs improvement. If simulators could offer automated and validated performance feedback, this would facilitate improvements in the delivery of training by allowing trainees to practise and self-assess.},

abstract={Objectives Improved real-time cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) sequences have currently been introduced, but so far only limited practical experience exists. This study aimed at image reconstruction optimization and clinical validation of a new highly accelerated real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE sequence. Methods Left ventricular (LV) short-axis stacks of a real-time free-breathing SPARSE-SENSE sequence with high spatiotemporal resolution and of a standard segmented cine SSFP sequence were acquired at 1.5 T in 11 volunteers and 15 patients. To determine the optimal iterations, all volunteers' SPARSE-SENSE images were reconstructed using 10-200 iterations, and contrast ratios, image entropies, and reconstruction times were assessed. Subsequently, the patients' SPARSE-SENSE images were reconstructed with the clinically optimal iterations. LV volumetric values were evaluated and compared between both sequences. Results Sufficient image quality and acceptable reconstruction times were achieved when using 80 iterations. Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok regression showed good agreement for all volumetric parameters. Conclusions 80 iterations are recommended for iterative SPARSE-SENSE image reconstruction in clinical routine. Real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE yielded comparable volumetric results as the current standard SSFP sequence. Due to its intrinsic low image acquisition times, real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE imaging with iterative image reconstruction seems to be an attractive alternative for LV function analysis. Key Points * A highly accelerated real-time CMR sequence using SPARSE-SENSE was evaluated. * SPARSE-SENSE allows free breathing in real-time cardiac cine imaging. * For clinically optimal SPARSE-SENSE image reconstruction, 80 iterations are recommended. * Real-time SPARSE-SENSE imaging yielded comparable volumetric results as the reference SSFP sequence. * The fast SPARSE-SENSE sequence is an attractive alternative to standard SSFP sequences.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special cervical spine issue Background and Purpose The use of virtual reality (VR) for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. Methods This reliability study included 46 asymptomatic participants, who were assessed using the neck VR system which displayed an interactive VR scenario via a head-mounted device, controlled by neck movements. The objective of the interactive assessment was to hit 16 targets, randomly appearing in four directions, as fast as possible. Each participant was tested twice by two different testers. Results Good reliability was found of neck motion kinematic measures in flexion, extension, and rotation (0.64-0.93 inter-class correlation). High reliability was shown for peak velocity globally (0.93), in left rotation (0.9), right rotation and extension (0.88), and flexion (0.86). Mean velocity had a good global reliability (0.84), except for left rotation directed movement with moderate reliability (0.68). Minimal detectable change for peak velocity ranged from 41 to 53 °/s, while mean velocity ranged from 20 to 25 °/s. Conclusions The results suggest high reliability for peak and mean velocity as measured by the interactive Neck VR assessment of neck motion kinematics. VR appears to provide a reliable and more ecologically valid method of cervical motion evaluation than previous conventional methodologies.},

abstract={Objectives The aim was to determine the proton MR (1H-MR) spectra of normal adult testes and variations with age. Methods Forty-one MR spectra of normal testes, including 16 testes from men aged 20-39 years (group I) and 25 testes from men aged 40-69 years (group II), were analyzed. A single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS), with TR/TE: 2000/25 ms was used. The volume of interest was placed to include the majority of normal testicular parenchyma. Association between normalized metabolite concentrations, defined as ratios of the calculated metabolite concentrations relative to creatine concentration, and age was assessed. Results Quantified metabolites of the spectra were choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mI), scyllo-inositol, taurine, lactate, GLx compound, glucose, lipids, and macromolecules resonating at 0.9 ppm (LM09), around 20 ppm (LM20), and at 13 ppm (LM13). Most prominent peaks were Cho, Cr, mI, and lipids. A weak negative correlation between mI and age (P=0.015) was observed. Higher normalized concentrations of Cho (P=0.03), mI (P=0.08), and LM13 (P=0.05) were found in group I than in group II. Conclusions 1H-MR spectra of a normal adult testis showed several metabolite peaks. A decrease of levels of Cho, mI, and LM13 was observed with advancing age. Key Points * Single-voxel PRESS MRS of a normal testis is feasible. * 1H-MR spectra of a normal testis showed several metabolite peaks. * Most prominent peaks were Cho, Cr, mI, and lipids. * A decrease of Cho, mI, and LM13 was seen with advancing age.},

abstract={Issue Title: The protectors of the knee: Meniscus and cartilage Purpose This study was to determine face and construct validity of a new virtual reality-based shoulder arthroscopy simulator which uses passive haptic feedback. Methods Fifty-one participants including 25 novices (100 shoulder arthroscopies) completed two tests: for assessment of face validity, a questionnaire was filled out concerning quality of simulated reality and training potential using a 7-point Likert scale (range 1-7). Construct validity was tested by comparing simulator metrics (operation time in seconds, camera and grasper pathway in centimetre and grasper openings) between novices and experts test results. Results Overall simulated reality was rated high with a median value of 5.5 (range 2.8-7) points. Training capacity scored a median value of 5.8 (range 3-7) points. Experts were significantly faster in the diagnostic test with a median of 91 (range 37-208) s than novices with 1177 (range 81-383) s (p < 0.0001) and in the therapeutic test 102 (range 58-283) s versus 229 (range 114-399) s (p < 0.0001). Similar results were seen in the other metric values except in the camera pathway in the therapeutic test. Conclusion The tested simulator achieved high scores in terms of realism and training capability. It reliably discriminated between novices and experts. Further improvements of the simulator, especially in the field of therapeutic arthroscopy, might improve its value as training and assessment tool for shoulder arthroscopy skills.

Yet, the existing asymptotic analysis of this test statistic is limited to a model in which the errors are assumed to follow a simple AR(1) structure with homogenous autoregressive coefficients. One reason for this is that the model involves an intricate identification issue, as both the serial and cross-section correlation structures of the errors are unobserved. The purpose of the current paper is to tackle this issue and in so doing extend the existing analysis to the case of AR(......) errors with possibly heterogeneous coefficients.},

abstract={The Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt (EPOB), which geographically corresponds to the northeastern part of Turkey, is still controversial due to lack of systematic geological, geochemical and chronological data. This paper provides new geochemical and chronological data from the Kuyucak and Erdembaba volcanics exposed along the North Anatolian Fault Zone, which is one of the most seismically-active intracontinental strike-slip fault systems on the globe, in the Reºadiye (Tokat) area that is situated in the southern part of the EPOB. Kuyucak volcanics consist predominantly of basaltic rocks including mainly olivine, augite and plagioclase. Erdembaba volcanics comprise mainly dacite and minor trachydacite-trachyandesite that are composed mainly of augite, plagioclase, hornblende and rarely biotite. The Geochemical properties of the Erdembaba volcanic define small amounts of magma mixing events and it follow a linear trend from a primitive end member through to upper crustal evolution. The ^sup 40^Ar/^sup 39^Ar age determinations of whole rock of volcanic rock samples yielded the ages ranging from 1.33 to 6.31 Ma (late Miocene- Pleistocene). Both groups display an enrichment in LIL and LREE elements relative to HFS and HREE elements, strong negative Nb and Ti anomalies. All geochemical and Ar/Ar chronological data indicate that the late Miocene Kuyucak volcanic rocks, which are characterized by low concentrations of SiO2 (<50 wt.%), were generated by mantlederived magmas that underwent contamination processes during their transfer to the surface. Whereas, Erdembaba volcanic rocks including high concentrations of SiO2 were derived from partial melting of the plunging continental crust beneath the Eurasian plate in Pliocene, after closure of Neotethys ocean that was situated in the southern part of the EPOB.},

abstract={Targeting the nonstationary and non-Gaussian characteristics of vibration signal from fault rolling bearing, this paper proposes a fault feature extraction method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and autoregressive (AR) model parameters. Firstly, VMD is applied to decompose vibration signals and a series of stationary component signals can be obtained. Secondly, AR model is established for each component mode. Thirdly, the parameters and remnant of AR model served as fault characteristic vectors. Finally, a novel random forest (RF) classifier is put forward for pattern recognition in the field of rolling bearing fault diagnosis. The validity and superiority of proposed method are verified by an experimental dataset. Analysis results show that this method based on VMD-AR model can extract fault features accurately and RF classifier has been proved to outperform comparative classifiers.},

abstract={Purpose Virtual reality simulator training has become important for acquiring arthroscopic skills. A new simulator for knee arthroscopy ArthroS(TM) has been developed. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate face and construct validity, executed according to a protocol used previously to validate arthroscopic simulators. Methods Twenty-seven participants were divided into three groups having different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants answered questions regarding general information and the outer appearance of the simulator for face validity. Construct validity was assessed with one standardized navigation task. Face validity, educational value and user friendliness were further determined by giving participants three exercises and by asking them to fill out the questionnaire. Results Construct validity was demonstrated between experts and beginners. Median task times were not significantly different for all repetitions between novices and intermediates, and between intermediates and experts. Median face validity was 8.3 for the outer appearance, 6.5 for the intra-articular joint and 4.7 for surgical instruments. Educational value and user friendliness were perceived as nonsatisfactory, especially because of the lack of tactile feedback. Conclusion The ArthroS(TM) demonstrated construct validity between novices and experts, but did not demonstrate full face validity. Future improvements should be mainly focused on the development of tactile feedback. It is necessary that a newly presented simulator is validated to prove it actually contributes to proficiency of skills.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion MR imaging for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect as alternatives to dynamic-susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion MR imaging when the DSC image is uninterpretable. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. Seventy one post-treatment glioblastoma patients who showed enlarged contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up MR images after concurrent chemoradiotherapy and uninterpretable DSC images for corresponding enhancing lesions, underwent additional DWI and DCE MR imaging. The primary outcome was the frequency of interpretable DWI and DCE MR cases in these 71 patients. The secondary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DWI and DCE imaging parameters for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images. The imaging parameters were quantified as 10% cumulative histogram cutoff of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC10) and 90% cumulative histogram cutoff of initial area under the time signal intensity curve (IAUC90). The AUCs were cross-validated by using leave-one-out method. Results Of the 71 patients, the uninterpretable DSC images were associated with treatment-related hemorrhage within the corresponding enhancing lesions (n = 54, 76.1%) and a near skull base location (n = 17, 23.9%). The frequencies of interpretable DWI and DCE image were 51 (71.8%) and 59 (83.1%) of the 71 cases with uninterpretable DSC images, respectively. Of the 45 selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images, the combination of DWI with DCE imaging showed a superior diagnostic performance than DWI or DCE imaging alone for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect (cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.55 and 0.73 for reader 1; cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.53 and 0.75 for reader 2, respectively). Cross-validated accuracy of the single and combined imaging parameters also showed the highest for the combination of DWI with DCE MR imaging (72.9% for reader 1; 72.5% for reader 2) and the lowest for DWI alone (54.0% for reader 1; 56.4% for reader 2). Inter-reader agreement for DCE imaging was higher than that for DWI (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.95 versus 0.87). Conclusion DCE MR imaging could be a superior and more reproducible imaging biomarker than DWI for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in patients with post-treatment glioblastoma when DSC MR images are not interpretable.},

abstract={Several methods have been proposed to estimate the force of a semiactive damper, particularly of a magnetorheological damper because of its importance in automotive and civil engineering. Usually, all models have been proposed assuming experimental data in nominal operating conditions and some of them are estimated for control purposes. Because dampers are prone to fail, fault estimation is useful to design adaptive vibration controllers to accommodate the malfunction in the suspension system. This paper deals with the diagnosis and estimation of faults in an automotive magnetorheological damper. A robust LPV observer is proposed to estimate the lack of force caused by a damper leakage in a vehicle corner. Once the faulty damper is isolated in the vehicle and the fault is estimated, an Adaptive Vibration Control System is proposed to reduce the fault effect using compensation forces from the remaining healthy dampers. To fulfill the semiactive damper constraints in the fault adaptation, an LPV controller is designed for vehicle comfort and road holding. Simulation results show that the fault observer has good performance with robustness to noise and road disturbances and the proposed AVCS improves the comfort up to 24% with respect to a controlled suspension without fault tolerance features.},

abstract={To measure the test-retest reproducibility of an automated system for quantifying whole body and compartmental muscle volumes using wide bore 3 T MRI. Thirty volunteers stratified by body mass index underwent whole body 3 T MRI, two-point Dixon sequences, on two separate occasions. Water-fat separation was performed, with automated segmentation of whole body, torso, upper and lower leg volumes, and manually segmented lower leg muscle volumes. Mean automated total body muscle volume was 19·32 L (SD9·1) and 19·28 L (SD9·12) for first and second acquisitions (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=1·0, 95 % level of agreement -0·32-0·2 L). ICC for all automated test-retest muscle volumes were almost perfect (0·99-1·0) with 95 % levels of agreement 1.8-6.6 % of mean volume. Automated muscle volume measurements correlate closely with manual quantification (right lower leg: manual 1·68 L (2SD0·6) compared to automated 1·64 L (2SD 0·6), left lower leg: manual 1·69 L (2SD 0·64) compared to automated 1·63 L (SD0·61), correlation coefficients for automated and manual segmentation were 0·94-0·96). Fully automated whole body and compartmental muscle volume quantification can be achieved rapidly on a 3 T wide bore system with very low margins of error, excellent test-retest reliability and excellent correlation to manual segmentation in the lower leg. * Sarcopaenia is an important reversible complication of a number of diseases. * Manual quantification of muscle volume is time-consuming and expensive. * Muscles can be imaged using in and out of phase MRI. * Automated atlas-based segmentation can identify muscle groups. * Automated muscle volume segmentation is reproducible and can replace manual measurements.

abstract={An effective damper is required to give good performance over a wide range of vibrational frequencies. To achieve this, the damping coefficient of the damper must be variable. The Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids are the fluids used in this type of dampers to achieve the objective. In this paper, a mathematical design of the MR damper is presented. For this, the magnetic circuit of the MR damper is designed and analyzed, which subsequently determines the damping force at different magnetic fields applied to it. The magnetic field can be controlled by the current input given to the electromagnet. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on ANSYS platform is carried out to obtain magnetic flux density in the working space of the damper. The damping force of the FEM model is determined for the damper. Lastly, these two models are validated experimentally in terms of damping force at various input current levels. For this purpose, a prototype of the MR damper is fabricated and tested in the newly setup vibration control laboratory of the department. A comparative analysis of the three models shows that the maximum percentage error in the damping force is within the 12% level with the experimental one and thus validates the mathematical and FEM modeling. The results obtained will be helpful for the automobile designers to create more efficient and reliable MR dampers and also to predict its damping force characteristics.},

abstract={Testing for causality is of critical importance for many econometric applications. For bivariate AR(1) processes, the limit distributions of causality tests based on least squares estimation depend on the presence of nonstationary processes. When nonstationary processes are present, the limit distributions of such tests are usually very complicated, and the full-sample bootstrap method becomes inconsistent as pointed out in Choi (2005, Statistics and Probability Letters 75, 39-48). In this paper, a profile empirical likelihood method is proposed to test for causality. The proposed test statistic is robust against the presence of nonstationary processes in the sense that one does not have to determine the existence of nonstationary processes a priori. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed test statistic works well.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Validating cyber-interventions Previous investigations conducted on post-secondary adult students with learning disabilities (LD) suggest that deficits in visual-motor skills contribute to difficulties in written expression which impact academic achievement. Intervention strategies for individuals with LD include assistive computer-based technologies (ATs) to compensate for or maximize performance. However, research fails to assess the impact of ATs on performance, learning, and motivation of students with LD. Also, one of the limitations of ATs is that they cannot be used for assessment and training and there are very few methods to assess or train visual-motor skills in this population. The present study explores the usefulness of a hapto-visual virtual reality motor skills assessment (MSA) device for visual-motor functioning in adults with and without LD. This is a preliminary step of developing an intervention to improve impaired visual-motor skills in adults with LD. A sample of 22 male and female university students with and without LD had their visual-motor skills pretested using a standard paper-and-pencil Bender-Gestalt (BG) test and were compared according to their performance on the MSA tool. We hypothesized that our LD participants' performance would be significantly lower than our control participants on the VR task in terms of number of errors and speed. Results showed that participants without LD performed better and more rapidly on the VR task than participants with LD. There were no correlations between the BG and MSA performance. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the Bender-Gestalt scores, previous experience with video game, arousal, and mood. Our results suggest that a novel 3D virtual reality tool such as the MSA can potentially discriminate motor function of people with and without LD; however, the difference between both may also be due to a lack of problem-solving ability in LD.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Objective. With the increase in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery there is a concomitant rising demand for training methods. The objective was to establish face and construct validity of a novel virtual reality simulator (dV-Trainer, Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA) for the use in training of robot-assisted surgery. Methods. A comparative cohort study was performed. Participants (n=42 ) were divided into three groups according to their robotic experience. To determine construct validity, participants performed three different exercises twice. Performance parameters were measured. To determine face validity, participants filled in a questionnaire after completion of the exercises. Results. Experts outperformed novices in most of the measured parameters. The most discriminative parameters were "time to complete" and "economy of motion" (P<0.001 ). The training capacity of the simulator was rated 4.6 ± 0.5 SD on a 5-point Likert scale. The realism of the simulator in general, visual graphics, movements of instruments, interaction with objects, and the depth perception were all rated as being realistic. The simulator is considered to be a very useful training tool for residents and medical specialist starting with robotic surgery. Conclusions. Face and construct validity for the dV-Trainer could be established. The virtual reality simulator is a useful tool for training robotic surgery.},

abstract={We introduce a method for the detailed interpretation of K-Ar illite fine-fraction ages of fault gouges from non-sedimentary host rocks. Ages are cross-evaluated with several independent parameters, e.g. illite crystallinity, illite polytype quantification, grain size, mineralogical observations, K-Ar muscovite and biotite host-rock cooling ages as well as low-temperature thermochronological data (AFT, AHe, ZHe). This interpretation approach is applied to a regional study in order to constrain the 'deformation path' of the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas in NW Argentina. In the course of this study, a large number of gouge-bearing fault zones were systematically sampled and analysed. Obtained K-Ar illite fine-fraction ages range from Devonian to Cretaceous times, documenting a long-lasting brittle fault activity in this region. Ages >320 Ma are synchronous with a period of intra-Carboniferous compressional tectonism, whereas Permo-Triassic ages are contemporaneous to a flat-slab subduction episode of the Farallon plate beneath the South American plate. Middle to Late Permian and Early Triassic ages as well as Early Jurassic to Middle Cretaceous ages correlate with extensional tectonics in this region. Additionally, K-Ar illite ages reveal a propagation of brittle deformation from north to south in the Sierras de Córdoba and San Luis. Data integrity and consistency with other chronometers and geological evidence show that the here suggested interpretation is valid and can provide a powerful tool to evaluate cooling and deformation histories. Despite of that, we could show that the reliability of fault gouge data strongly depends on the regional cooling.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={There is a close relation between cartilage health and its hydration state. Current magnetic resonance methods allow visualizing this tissue. However, a quantitative analysis is more useful when studying disease. The purpose of this study was to quantify water content in cartilage using magnetic resonance without contrast agents. Water-content estimations using T1 magnetic resonance mapping were done first in eight gelatin samples where the water content was previously known. The same method was used in the physeal areas of eight skeletally immature 30-kg pigs. To calculate accuracy, T1 calculations were compared to dry-freeze, which is considered the gold standard because it can remove the total water content form a tissue. Four fresh cartilage and seven gelatin samples were dry-frozen. Water content obtained from dry-freeze was compared to the one calculated from T1 map values. A mathematical model and statistical analysis were used to calculate the predictive value of the method and its significance. T1-map-based magnetic resonance method can calculate water content in cartilage with an accuracy of 97.3 %. We calculated a coefficient of variance for this method against dry-frozen sample of 3.68 (SD=1.2) in gelatin samples, and 2.73 (SD=1.3) in in vivo samples. Between two independent observers, the coefficient of variance was 0.053, which suggests it can be easily reproduced. Magnetic resonance was able to calculate, with high accuracy, the cartilage water content using T1 mapping sequences.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

To provide a biological basis for these values, their relation with histopathology was assessed. DWI was performed twice in 1 week in patients scheduled for metastasectomy of colorectal liver metastases. Correlation between ADC values and apoptosis marker p53, anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, proliferation marker Ki67 and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration were assessed. A good reproducibility coefficient of the mean ADC (coefficient of reproducibility 0.20 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s) was observed in colorectal liver metastases (n=21). The ADC value was related to the proliferation index and BCL-2 expression of the metastases. Furthermore, in metastases recently treated with systemic therapy, the ADC was significantly higher (1.27 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s vs 1.05 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s, P=0.02). The good reproducibility, correlation with histopathology and implied sensitivity for systemic treatment-induced anti-tumour effects suggest that DWI might be an excellent tool to monitor response in metastatic colorectal cancer. * ADC values are becoming important oncological biomarkers * DWI provides reproducibile ADC values in colorectal liver metastases * The coefficient of reproducibility of the mean ADC is 0.20 × 10 ^sup -3^ mm ^sup 2^ /s * ADC values correlate with proliferation index and are related to BCL-2 expression PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Compared with X-ray coronary angiography (CAG), magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary vessel wall (MR-CVW) may provide more information about plaque burden and coronary remodelling. We compared MR-CVW with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), the standard of reference for coronary vessel wall imaging, with regard to plaque detection and wall thickness measurements. In this study 17 patients with chest pain, who had been referred for CAG, were included. Patients underwent IVUS and MR-CVW imaging of the right coronary artery (RCA). Subsequently, the coronary vessel wall was analysed for the presence and location of coronary plaques. Fifty-two matching RCA regions of interest were available for comparison. There was good agreement between IVUS and MR-CVW for qualitative assessment of presence of disease, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 76%. Wall thickness measurements demonstrated a significant difference between mean wall thickness on IVUS and MR-CVW (0.48 vs 1.24 mm, P<0.001), but great heterogeneity between wall thickness measurements, resulting in a low correlation between IVUS and MR-CVW. MR-CVW has high sensitivity for the detection of coronary vessel wall thickening in the RCA compared with IVUS. However, the use of MRI for accurate absolute wall thickness measurements is not supported when a longitudinal acquisition orientation is used. * Both MRI and IVUS can assess coronary vessels * Both MRI and IVUS can identify coronary vessel wall thickening. * MRI provides more information about the coronary plaque burden than conventional angiography. * However, MRI overestimates absolute coronary wall thickness when compared with IVUS.

abstract={Objectives The purpose of our study was to assess the chondrogenic potential and the MR signal effects of GadofluorineM-Cy labeled matrix associated stem cell implants (MASI) in pig knee specimen. Materials and Methods Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were labeled with the micelle-based contrast agent GadofluorineM-Cy. Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs, non-labeled hMSCs and scaffold only served as controls. Chondrogenic differentiation was induced and gene expression and histologic evaluation were performed. The proportions of spindle-shaped vs. round cells of chondrogenic pellets were compared between experimental groups using the Fisher's exact test. Labeled and unlabeled hMSCs and chondrocytes in scaffolds were implanted into cartilage defects of porcine femoral condyles and underwent MR imaging with T1- and T2-weighted SE and GE sequences. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) between implants and adjacent cartilage were determined and analyzed for significant differences between different experimental groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was assigned for p0.017). However, hMSC differentiation into chondrocytes was superior for unlabeled and GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled cells compared with Ferucarbotran-labeled cells, as evidenced by a significantly higher proportion of spindle cells in chondrogenic pellets (p<0.05). GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled hMSCs and chondrocytes showed a positive signal effect on T1-weighted images and a negative signal effect on T2-weighted images while Ferucarbotran-labeled cells provided a negative signal effect on all sequences. CNR data for both GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled and Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs were significantly different compared to unlabeled control cells on T1-weighted SE and T2*-weighted MR images (p<0.017). Conclusion hMSCs can be labeled by simple incubation with GadofluorineM-Cy. The labeled cells provide significant MR signal effects and less impaired chondrogenesis compared to Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs. Thus, GadoflurineM-Cy might represent an alternative MR cell marker to Ferucarbotran, which is not distributed any more in Europe or North America.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to experimentally validate the performance of a semi-active suspension incorporating a magneto-rheological damper (MR), where the parameters of the numerical models are often poorly adapted to real responses measured experimentally. To ensure a better representation of a real semi-active suspension, we must consider the internal dynamics of the MR damper in its numerical modeling. By adopting models which demonstrate that dynamic, such as the Bingham and Bouc-Wen models, we can approach the measured responses by adjusting their internal parameters. The law control introduction for feedback control of the semi-active suspension incorporating the internal dynamics of the MR damper allows, through the analysis of its robustness and response time, to better assess its performance. To validate the performance of these models, a comparative analysis was made between the experimentally measured responses by the dSPACE system used as an acquisition and control chain and the calculated or predicted responses. A rapprochement between measured responses and those calculated for the same dynamic characteristics of the test bed is possible by adjusting the most influential parameters of Bouc-Wen model.},

abstract={This study was an open-label, single-group, treatment-development project aimed at developing and testing a method for applying virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) to active duty service members diagnosed with combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Forty-two service members with PTSD were enrolled, and 20 participants completed treatment. The PTSD Checklist-Military version, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used as outcome measures. Of those who completed post-treatment assessment, 75% had experienced at least a 50% reduction in PTSD symptoms and no longer met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD at post treatment. Average PSTD scores decreased by 50.4%, depression scores by 46.6%, and anxiety scores by 36%. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that statistically significant improvements in PTSD, depression, and anxiety occurred over the course of treatment and were maintained at follow up. There were no adverse events associated with VRET treatment. This study provides preliminary support for the use of VRET in combat-related PTSD. Further study will be needed to determine the wider utility of the method and to determine if it offers advantages over other established PTSD treatment modalities.},

abstract={Spectral kurtosis (SK) is an algorithm that gives an indication of how kurtosis varies with frequency. A frequency band that contains abundant information, especially the impact signal, can be tracked by calculating SK. In the present article, SK combined with Autoregressive AR model, was applied into the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of bearings. Accelerated life test of rolling bearings in Hangzhou Bearing Test & Research Center (HBRC) was performed to collect vibration data over their entire lifetime (normal-fault-failure). The result shows that SK can detect early incipient fault by eliminating some other interfering frequency components. In addition, it can detect fault 5 min earlier than root mean value (RMS). This fault detection in advance is significant for condition monitoring.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The manuscript provides new insight into methods to date faults Study is focussed on an important regional structure of Korea The Deokpori Thrust, juxtaposing the early Paleozoic Yeongwol-type Joseon Supergroup (Yeongwol Group) against the Duwibong-type Joseon Supergroup (Taebaek Group) in the Okcheon belt, is an important regional structure in the Phanerozoic tectonic evolution of Korea. Although the initiation of the thrust has recently been conjectured to occur during the Middle Jurassic Daebo tectonic event in a continental magmatic arc setting, its movement history has never been studied. We report timing of brittle reactivation of the thrust obtained from K-Ar dating of fault gouges in the core of the Deokpori Thrust zone. K-Ar illite age data of fault gouges suggest reactivation of the thrust at ca. 72 Ma after a contact metamorphism around 94 Ma. Our result is the first documentation of the reactivation of a major Jurassic Daebo structure and the reactivation may represent a significant contractional tectonic event during the Late Cretaceous in the Korean Peninsula.},

abstract={The Sierras Pampeanas in central and north-western Argentina constitute a distinct morphotectonic feature between 27°S and 33°S. The last stage of uplift and deformation in this area are interpreted to be closely related to the Andean flat-slab subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate. K-Ar fault gouge dating and low-temperature thermochronology along two transects within the Sierra de Comechingones reveal a minimum age for the onset of brittle deformation about 340 Ma, very low exhumation rates since Late Paleozoic time, as well as a total exhumation of about 2.3 km since the Late Cretaceous. New Ar-Ar ages (7.54-1.91 Ma) of volcanic rocks from the San Luis volcanic belt support the eastward propagation of the flat-slab magmatic front, confirming the onset of flat-slab related deformation in this region at 11.2 Ma. Although low-temperature thermochronology does not clearly constrain the signal of the Andean uplift, it is understood that the current structural relief related to the Comechingones range has been achieved after the exhumation of both fault walls (circa 80-70 Ma).PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of adding combined 18F-PET/CT to MRI for T and N staging of the oral and oropharyngeal cancer and calculation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) having histopathology as reference standard. PET/CT and MRI were performed in 66 patients with suspected oral and oropharyngeal cancer (41 primary tumors/25 recurrent tumors) and nodal disease (114 nodes). Statistical analysis included the McNemar test, sensitivity, specificity for the diagnostic modalities as well as regression analysis, and Bland-Altman graphs for calculated tumor volumes. There was no statistically significant difference between the two modalities compared to pathological findings regarding detection of disease (P≥0.72). The sensitivity/specificity for tumor detection were 100/80% and 96.72/60% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. The sensitivity/specificity for nodal metastases were 88.46/75% and 83.81/73.91% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. In 18% of cases, the MRI-based T staging resulted in an overestimation of the pathologic tumor stage. The corresponding rate for PET/CT was 22%. Regarding the treated necks, both modalities showed 100% sensitivity for detection of the recurrent lesions. In necks with histologically N0 staging, MRI and PET/CT gave 22% and 26% false positive findings, respectively. The mean tumor volume in the pathologic specimen was 16.6±18.6 ml, the mean volume derived by the MR imaging was 17.6±19.1 ml while the estimated by PET/CT volume was 18.8±18.1 ml (P≤0.007 between the three methods). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a better agreement between PET/CT and MRI. The diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in the local staging of oral cancer is not superior to MRI.

LFF (corrected for T1 and T2* decays) was also obtained from the mean signal intensity on a map built from a triple-echo (consecutive in-phase, opposed-phase, and in-phase echo times) breath-hold gradient echo sequence, using basic image calculation functions (arithmetic mean, subtraction, division, multiplication by a numerical factor). Mean LFF was 8.9% (range, 0.9-33.5) by MRI and 8.8% (range, 0-34.1) by 1H-MRS. Pearson's coefficient was 0.976 (P<0.0001) and Lin's coefficient was 0.975 (P<0.0001). Liver segment had no significant influence. With Bland-Altman analysis, 95.6% (87/91) of data points were within the limits of agreement.

We investigated 24 subjects with known mutations in thePAX6gene (including representatives of all the known mutations of the gene) which are associated with characteristic ocular abnormalities in humans and animals. We have quantified MRI data using several techniques to assess qualities of cerebral structure which are difficult to interpret visually. Abnormalities were identified using voxel-based morphometry, statistical morphometrics, and measurement of corpus callosum cross-sectional area when comparing data from subjects withPAX6abnormality and 72 age-and sex-matched control subjects. These abnormalities include grey matter changes in the cerebellum and occipital poles and white matter loss in the corpus callosum, alteration of sulcal orientation in the occipital lobe, and alteration to overall neuronal connectivity. These abnormalities complement and exceed the changes seen in the mouse models, and those seen on visual inspection alone of the human MRI data. Structural differences were also identified between the two largest genotype mutation subgroups.},

abstract={Background The study was carried out to analyze the learning rate for laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality training system and to establish whether the simulator was able to differentiate between surgeons with different laparoscopic experience. Methods Forty-one surgeons were divided into three groups according to their experience in laparoscopic surgery: masters (group 1, performed more than 100 cholecystectomies), intermediates (group 2, between 15 and 80 cholecystectomies), and beginners (group 3, fewer than 10 cholecystectomies) were included in the study. The participants were tested on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) 10 consecutive times within a 1-month period. Assessment of laparoscopic skills included time, errors, and economy of hand movement, measured by the simulator. Results The learning curves regarding time reached plateau after the second repetition for group 1, the fifth repetition for group 2, and the seventh repetition for group 3 (Friedman's testsP0.2) indicating the absence of a learning curve for these parameters. Group 2 error scores reached plateau after the first repetition, and group 3 after the fifth repetition. Group 2 improved their economy of movement score up to the third repetition and group 3 up to the sixth repetition (Friedman's tests,P<0.05). Experienced surgeons (group 1) demonstrated best performance parameters, followed by group 2 and group 3 (Mann-Whitney testP<0.05). Conclusions Different learning curves existed for surgeons with different laparoscopic background. The familiarization rate on the simulator was proportional to the operative experience of the surgeons. Experienced surgeons demonstrated best laparoscopic performance on the simulator, followed by those with intermediate experience and the beginners. These differences indicate that the scoring system of MIST-VR is sensitive and specific to measuring skills relevant for laparoscopic surgery.},

abstract={Three different geochronological techniques (stepwise-heating, laser-ablation 40Ar/39Ar, Rb-Sr microsampling) have been evaluated for dating fault-generated pseudotachylytes sampled along the Periadriatic Fault System (PAF) of the Alps. Because pseudotachylytes are whole-rock systems composed of melt, clast and alteration phases, chemical control from both Ar isotopes (Cl/K, Ca/K ratios) and EMPA analyses is crucial for their discrimination. When applied to stepwise-heating 40Ar/39Ar analyses, this approach yields accurate melt-related ages, even for complex age spectra. The spatial resolution of laser-ablation 40Ar/39Ar analyses is capable of contrasting melt, clast and alteration phases in situ, provided the clasts are not too fine grained, the latter of which results in integrated "mixed" ages without geological information. Elevated Cl/K and Ca/K ratios were found to be an invaluable indicator for the presence of clast admixture or inherited 40Ar. Due to incomplete isotopic resetting during frictional melting, Rb-Sr microsampling dating did not furnish geologically meaningful ages. On the basis of isotopic disequilibria among pseudotachylyte matrix phases, and independent Rb-Sr microsampling dating of cogenetic (ultra)mylonites, the concordant 40Ar/39Ar pseudotachylyte ages are interpreted as formation ages. The investigated pseudotachylytes altogether reveal a Cretaceous to Miocene history for the entire PAF, consistent with independent geological evidence. Individual faults, however, consistently reveal narrower intervals of enhanced activity lasting a few million years.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate a velocity-encoded cine-MR (VEC-MR) sequence in measuring flow velocities up to two times the velocity encoding value (VENC) in a flow phantom and to validate the method for assessing poststenotic jet velocities in postoperative patients after aortic coarctation. In vitro, a flow phantom was used (0.5T; TR/TE: 51/8 ms, flip angle=30°, FOV=280 mm, 128×256 matrix VENC 40 or 80 cm/s). On binary images, maximum flow velocities (V^sub max^) were calculated with a region of interest (ROI, 8 pixels). With aliasing, V^sub max^ was calculated by VENC+(V^sub aliasing^). In vivo, 16 postoperative patients after aortic coarctation underwent double-oblique VEC-MR imaging through the aortic arch (ECG triggering, 16 phases/RR, TR=600-800 ms, flow-encoding cranio-caudal, VENC=2 m/s). Peak systolic velocities were measured and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) was performed. In vitro, there were excellent correlations for MR velocity measurements with and without aliasing (r=0.99) and for true and MR-derived flow velocities (r=0.99). In vivo, there was good correlation between VEC-MR and TTDE-assessed V^sub max^ values in the aorta at the former coarctation site (r=0.90, n=16). Aliasing occurred in 13 patients. VEC-MR is a useful modality for assessing jet velocities in the follow-up of patients after aortic coarctation. Despite of aliasing, accurate velocity measurements up to two times VENC are possible using binary images.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
