abstract = {Automated brain MR image segmentation is a challenging pattern recognition problem that received significant attention lately. The most popular solutions involve fuzzy c-means (FCM) or similar clustering mechanisms. Several improvements have been made to the standard FCM algorithm, in order to reduce its sensitivity to Gaussian, impulse, and intensity non-uniformity noises. This paper presents a modified FCM-based method that targets accurate and fast segmentation in case of mixed noises. The proposed method extracts a scalar feature value from the neighbourhood of each pixel, using a context dependent filtering technique that deals with both spatial and grey level distances. These features are clustered afterwards by the histogram-based approach of the enhanced FCM algorithm. Results were evaluated based on synthetic phantoms and real MR images. Test experiments revealed that the proposed method provides better results compared to other reported FCM-based techniques. The time complexity of the proposed method is situated well below the traditional FCM algorithm. The achieved segmentation and the obtained fuzzy membership values represent excellent support for deformable contour model based cortical surface reconstruction methods.}

In the proposed method, a region merging method is presented, which is based on employing the region adjacency graph (RAG) to improve the quality of watershed segmentation. The relation of inter-region similarities is then investigated using image mapping in the watershed and CHCN images to determine more appropriate region merging. The performance of the proposed technique is presented through quantitative and qualitative validation experiments on benchmark images. Significant and promising segmentation results were achieved on brain phantom simulated data.}

abstract = {In this paper an automatic atlas-based segmentation algorithm for 4D cardiac MR images is proposed. The algorithm is based on the 4D extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm uses a 4D probabilistic cardiac atlas to estimate the initial model parameters and to integrate a priori information into the classification process. The probabilistic cardiac atlas has been constructed from the manual segmentations of 3D cardiac image sequences of 14 healthy volunteers. It provides space and time-varying probability maps for the left and right ventricles, the myocardium, and background structures such as the liver, stomach, lungs and skin. In addition to using the probabilistic cardiac atlas as a priori information, the segmentation algorithm incorporates spatial and temporal contextual information by using 4D Markov Random Fields. After the classification, the largest connected component of each structure is extracted using a global connectivity filter which improves the results significantly, especially for the myocardium. Validation against manual segmentations and computation of the correlation between manual and automatic segmentation on 249 3D volumes were calculated. We used the 'leave one out' test where the image set to be segmented was not used in the construction of its corresponding atlas. Results show that the procedure can successfully segment the left ventricle (LV) (r=0.96), myocardium (r=0.92) and right ventricle (r=0.92). In addition, 4D images from 10 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were also manually and automatically segmented yielding a good correlation in the volumes of the LV (r=0.93) and myocardium (0.94) when the atlas constructed with volunteers is blurred.}

This binary mask is then superimposed on the corresponding data set yielding an image containing only CSF structures and lesions. The FCM is then reapplied to this masked image to obtain a mask of lesions and some undesired substructures which are removed using anatomical knowledge.

One is an adaptive inverse controller which can give necessary input voltage to MR damper so as to generate specified reference damping force to be acted on a controlled structure. The input voltage is decided using a nonlinear adaptive observer with identified model parameters of the MR damper which expresses hysteresis behavior of nonlinear dynamic friction mechanism of the MR fluid. The other is an adaptive reference controller which can match the dynamics of the first floor of structure to a reference dynamics. The proposed fully adaptive approach can cope with uncertainties in both models of MR damper and structure.

abstract = {Segmentation of medical images is a critical step to distinguish different regions, especially tumor. The presence of severe intensity inhomogeneity in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Mammogram images makes it difficult to assess and detect the boundaries of tumor. Tumor detection in medical images measures and identifies the structure of the tumor. This challenging task of extracting tumor i.e., region of interest is achieved by proposing a novel fuzzy selective model. The proposed model is mainly based on selective segmentation to detect the tumor in medical images. This model is based on the local Gaussian distribution as a fitting term with fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and irregular borders in medical images. Due to the usage of fuzzy membership functions, it avoids local minima and converges to the tumor boundary rapidly and efficiently. In addition, to obtain more information of a local intensity, the idea of multi-scale modeling is incorporated to achieve significant results. The proposed segmentation model is applied to diverse MRI and Mammogram datasets containing both the intensity inhomogeneity and noisy images, this data is collected from local hospitals and the ground truths are created by the experts. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed segmentation method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques using both the qualitative and quantitative assessment. Loss functions play very important role in CNN architectures, and is well studied research area. In the second part of the paper, we will be introducing a new loss function, which is introduced in the first part of the paper. Deep active contour architectures based Chan-Vese loss function works well in images with homogeneity and may not work well in images with intensity inhomogeneity. We proposed an architecture, whose loss function will be based on this new proposed model. The proposed model is used as a loss function in a newly introduced CNN architecture, which has produced improved results. The results of the new architecture are compared with other existing methods used for segmentation of medical images.}

Manifold coordinates of each image capture information about structural shape and appearance and, when a phenotype exists, about the subject’s clinical state. Our framework incorporates subject meta-information into the manifold learning step. Apart from gender and age, information such as genotype or a derived biomarker is often available in clinical studies and can inform the classification of a query subject. Such information, whether discrete or continuous, is used as an additional input to manifold learning, extending the Laplacian Eigenmap objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from pairwise image similarities. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven in contrast to a priori defined biomarkers derived from, e.g., manual or automated segmentations. They form a unified representation of both the imaging and non-imaging measurements, providing a natural use for data analysis and visualization. We test the method to classify subjects with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls enrolled in the ADNI study. Non-imaging metadata used are ApoE genotype, a risk factor associated with AD, and the CSF-concentration of Aβ1-42, an established biomarker for AD. In addition, we use hippocampal volume as a derived imaging-biomarker to enrich the learned manifold. Our classification results compare favorably to what has been reported in a recent meta-analysis using established neuroimaging methods on the same database.}

However, the evaluation criteria in the current approach to interior finishing material selection are limited to quantitative indicators such as material energy performance and life expectancy. Qualitative requirements such as visual-aesthetics preference, on the other hand, are overlooked. In this regard, this research proposes a novel immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based approach for user-centered interior finishing material selection which incorporates both visual aesthetics and conventional material performance. Conventional material performance is factored into a multi-criteria decision making analysis to determine finishing material type. On this basis, final material products are selected by interactively evaluating homeowner's visual-aesthetics preference during interactive particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO)-based material collocation optimization. Here a prototype system is developed within a game engine environment, Unity 3D, and implemented in the form of a head-mounted display device, HTC Vive, in order to provide an interactive and immersive user experience. A typical two-storey residential townhouse is used as a case study to test the developed prototype system. The test results show the proposed approach to be capable of effectively assisting users in selecting their desired interior finishing materials.}

abstract = {The depth of myometrial invasion affects the treatment and prognosis of patients with endometrial cancer (EC), conventionally evaluated using MR imaging (MRI). However, only a few computer-aided diagnosis methods have been reported for identifying deep myometrial invasion (DMI) using MRI. Moreover, these existing methods exhibit relatively unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity. This study proposes a novel computerized method to facilitate the accurate detection of DMI on MRI. This method requires only the corpus uteri region provided by humans or computers instead of the tumor region. We also propose a geometric feature called LS to describe the irregularity of the tissue structure inside the corpus uteri triggered by EC, which has not been leveraged for the DMI prediction model in other studies. Texture features are extracted and then automatically selected by recursive feature elimination. Utilizing a feature fusion strategy of strong and weak features devised in this study, multiple probabilistic support vector machines incorporate LS and texture features, which are then merged to form the ensemble model EPSVM. The model performance is evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation. We make the following comparisons, EPSVM versus the commonly used classifiers such as random forest, logistic regression, and naive Bayes; EPSVM versus the models using LS or texture features alone. The results show that EPSVM attains an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score of 93.7%, 94.7%, 93.3%, and 87.8%, all of which are higher than those of the commonly used classifiers and the models using LS or texture features alone. Compared with the methods in existing studies, EPSVM exhibits high performance in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, LS can achieve an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 89.9%, 89.5%, and 90.0%. Thus, the devised geometric feature LS is significant for DMI detection. The fusion of LS and texture features in the proposed EPSVM can provide more reliable prediction. The computer-aided classification based on the proposed method can assist radiologists in accurately identifying DMI on MRI.}

abstract = {Effective abnormality detection and diagnosis in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) requires a robust segmentation strategy. Since manual segmentation is a time-consuming task which engages valuable human resources, automatic MRI segmentations received an enormous amount of attention. For this goal, various techniques have been applied. However, Markov Random Field (MRF) based algorithms have produced reasonable results in noisy images compared to other methods. MRF seeks a label field which minimizes an energy function. The traditional minimization method, simulated annealing (SA), uses Monte Carlo simulation to access the minimum solution with heavy computation burden. For this reason, MRFs are rarely used in real time processing environments. This paper proposed a novel method based on MRF and a hybrid of social algorithms that contain an ant colony optimization (ACO) and a Gossiping algorithm which can be used for segmenting single and multispectral MRIs in real time environments. Combining ACO with the Gossiping algorithm helps find the better path using neighborhood information. Therefore, this interaction causes the algorithm to converge to an optimum solution faster. Several experiments on phantom and real images were performed. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional MRF and hybrid of MRF-ACO in speed and accuracy.}

With the recent technological advancements, virtual reality (VR) experiments could serve as an effective method to prepare civilians and law enforcement personnel for such scenarios. However, for VR experiments to be effective for active shooter training and research, such experiments must be able to evoke emotional and physiological responses as live active shooter drills and events do. The objective of this study is thus to test the effectiveness of an active shooter VR experiment on emotional and physiological responses. Additionally, we consider different locomotion techniques (i.e., walk-in-place and controller) and explore their impact on users’ sense of presence. The results suggest that the VR active shooter experiment in this study can induce emotional arousal and increase heart rate of the participants immersed in the virtual environment. Furthermore, compared to the controller, the walk-in-place technique resulted in a higher emotional arousal in terms of negative emotions and a stronger sense of presence. The study presents a foundation for future active shooter experiments as it supports the ecological validity using VR for active shooter incident related work for the purposes of training or research.}

MR–CT registration methods often rely on the statistical intensity relationship between the images. The proposed similarity measure instead depends on the statistical relationship between the complex phase order between the images. By utilizing the complex phase order likelihood (CPOL) as a similarity measure, structural relationships instead of intensity relationships are explicitly used. This approach can be advantageous for MR–CT registration, where the intensities of the CT imagery have highly complex and nonlinear relationships with the intensities of corresponding MR imagery but simpler linear structural relationships. This new similarity measure has been tested on real MR–CT 3D volumes and has been evaluated based on fiducial registration error to determine alignment accuracy. Quantitative results show that CPOL is capable of achieving comparable alignment accuracy when compared to normalized mutual information, while being more robust to imaging artifacts such as noise.}

In addition, we aim to increase learner’s interest in Japanese history and improve learning motivation. In addition, we aimed to be able to deepen understanding by introducing AR marker into the system, seeing it and moving it by hand. In order to confirm that the system is useful, 12 subjects used this system, and they answered a questionnaire about their feelings.}

abstract = {Efficient and accurate segmentation of the prostate and two of its clinically meaningful sub-regions: the central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ), from 3D MR images, is of great interest in image-guided prostate interventions and diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this work, a novel multi-region segmentation approach is proposed to simultaneously segment the prostate and its two major sub-regions from only a single 3D T2-weighted (T2w) MR image, which makes use of the prior spatial region consistency and incorporates a customized prostate appearance model into the segmentation task. The formulated challenging combinatorial optimization problem is solved by means of convex relaxation, for which a novel spatially continuous max-flow model is introduced as the dual optimization formulation to the studied convex relaxed optimization problem with region consistency constraints. The proposed continuous max-flow model derives an efficient duality-based algorithm that enjoys numerical advantages and can be easily implemented on GPUs. The proposed approach was validated using 18 3D prostate T2w MR images with a body-coil and 25 images with an endo-rectal coil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of efficiently and accurately extracting both the prostate zones: CG and PZ, and the whole prostate gland from the input 3D prostate MR images, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.3±3.2% for the whole gland (WG), 82.2±3.0% for the CG, and 69.1±6.9% for the PZ in 3D body-coil MR images; 89.2±3.3% for the WG, 83.0±2.4% for the CG, and 70.0±6.5% for the PZ in 3D endo-rectal coil MR images. In addition, the experiments of intra- and inter-observer variability introduced by user initialization indicate a good reproducibility of the proposed approach in terms of volume difference (VD) and coefficient-of-variation (CV) of DSC.}

abstract = {In this study, we propose an integrated approach based on iterative sliced inverse regression (ISIR) for the segmentation of ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) images. The approach integrates two stages. The first is the unsupervised clustering which combines multidimensional scaling (MDS) with K-Means. The dimension reduction based on MDS is employed to obtain fewer representative variates as input variables for K-Means. This step intends to generate the initial group labels of the training data for the second stage of supervised segmentation. We then combine the SIR with the nearest mean classifier (NMC) or the support vector machine (SVM) to iteratively update the group labels for supervised segmentation. The method of SIR is introduced by Li [Sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 86 (1991) 316–342] to explore the effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) directions from the training data embedded in high-dimensional space. The test data are then projected onto these directions and the classifiers are further applied to classify the test data. The integrated approach based on ISIR is evaluated on simulated and clinical images, which include ultrasound and MR images. The evaluation results indicate that this approach provides an improvement of image segmentation over the methods to be compared without dimension reduction.}

The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive semiactive control scheme is validated and the stability of the obtained total adaptive system is analyzed.}

Mole fraction profiles of all flame species (H2, O2, H2O, H2O2, H, O, OH, HO2) were measured. A decrease in the peak mole fractions of H, O, OH radicals and an increase in the peak mole fractions of HO2 and H2O2 with pressure was observed. Two detailed kinetic mechanisms proposed recently by Konnov (2008) and Burke et al. (2012) for hydrogen combustion were validated against new experimental data reported in this work. Both mechanisms reproduced well the mole fraction profiles of H2, O2, H2O and H, O, OH radicals in the flames. However, the mechanism of Burke et al. was found to be more adequate in predicting the mole fraction profiles of peroxy species in the flames. The observed changes in the flame structure with pressure were explained on the basis of a kinetic analysis of the model developed by Burke et al.

This chapter reports the field comparative tests of the cable-damper system under different damper installation setups. In this testing phase, one utmost stay cable of the bridge, about 150 m in length, is tested without damper and with single-damper and twin-damper installations respectively. Sinusoidal-delay excitation is imposed to excite the cable vibration with different levels of response and in different frequencies. A spectrum of voltage inputs is applied to the Magnetorheological (MR) damper(s) during the testing to relate the system damping behavior with voltage strength. A Hilbert transform based identification method is used to identify amplitude-dependent frequencies and damping of the cable-damper system and to determine the optimal voltage that achieves the maximum system damping. The research emphasis is laid on the comparison of in-plane as well as out-of-plane damping performance of the system between the single- and twin-damper setups. Forced vibration tests are conducted to experimentally determine the damping performance of a Dongting Lake Bridge cable attached with MR dampers in the single-damper setup and twin-damper setup, respectively. A new identification method based on the Hilbert transform has been applied to identify the amplitude-dependent frequencies and damping. Modal damping ratios of the cable-damper system under different vibration amplitudes and various voltage inputs are experimentally determined for both the single- and twin-damper setups.}

The precise choice of derivative approximation turns out to be crucial. The obtained results are compared to a prediction error method.}

Full penetration autogenous welds were made at a constant laser power of 4.9kW using a continuous-wave (CW) fibre laser at travel speeds of 3.0–5.0m/min and focal positions of +4 to −4mm. To investigate this effect, a comparison was made between Ar and He by examining the weld quality in terms of the face and root weld width, the weld width ratio; and the presence of welding defects including undercut, underfill, reinforcement, porosity and crack. Optical metallography, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-hardness indentation testing on weld cross-sections were used to identify how the chemical and physical properties of the shielding gases and the characteristics of the fibre laser affect the overall weld geometry. Based on the results, it was believed that relatively small influence of ionisation on fibre laser induced plume enhanced the welding process stability and lowered the threshold power density for keyhole formation. Both Ar and He shielding gases could therefore, be used effectively to produce good quality welds. However, at the lowest speed and also at the maximum focal position, higher ionisation potential and thermal conductivity of helium resulted in an excessive weld width when He was used even though, the overall weld quality was better than that with Ar.}

This issue is addressed by optimizing the phenomenological parameters to ensure robustness. Once the fundamental characteristics are tuned, minor adjustment can be carried out using current flow to meet the instantaneous demand for control force. For this purpose, subset simulation is proposed in this study. The rationale behind the selection of subset simulation is its ability to estimate probability using very few samples. The proposed robust design methodology is demonstrated using simulated samples of El Centro ground motions. However, the method is general and can be adopted for any other uncertainty model, specific to a particular structure or location. The proposed robust design of magneto-rheological elastomer is verified using a three-storied frame that clearly shows the advantage of tuning the phenomenological parameters of the isolator. Finally, the performance of the optimal isolator is also demonstrated using different recorded earthquakes and the performance of an isolator is discussed in the light of different structural performance index.}

The virtual displacement keeps positive in uploading (i.e., RC circuit in charging process) while negative in downloading (i.e., RC circuit in discharging process).

In this regard, clustering algorithms based on type-1 fuzzy set theory are suitable for the overlapping partitions while the rough set based clustering algorithms deal with uncertainty and vagueness. However, additional degree of fuzziness makes the clustering more challenging for various subtle uncertainties and noisy data in the overlapping areas. Hence, this fact motivates us to propose a hybrid technique, called Rough Possibilistic Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means clustering with the integration of Random Forest. In the proposed method, possibilistic approach handles the noisy data better, whereas the other various uncertainties and inherent vagueness are taken care by type-2 fuzzy set and rough set theories. After clustering, it produces rough and crisp points. Thereafter, such crisp points are used to train the Random Forest classifier in order to classify the rough points for yielding better clustering solution. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in comparison with several other recently proposed methods for MR brain image segmentation. Finally, superiority of the results produced by the proposed hybrid method has also been validated through statistical significance test.}

The displacement field of sandwich structure is written according to layerwise theory and the size-dependent strain energy is obtained based on modified first strain gradient theory (MFSGT). The Hamilton's principle is applied to derive the governing equations of motion. In order to solve the partial differential equations, the Galerkin method is applied. To validate the presented formulation and solution method, the obtained results are compared with the available results in the literature, which shows a good agreement. The first set of results investigate the first five natural frequencies of MR sandwich beam based on the different MR materials. The variations of frequency and corresponding loss factor are plotted against aerodynamic pressure, length scale parameters, axially speed, intensity of external magnetic field, yaw angle, and power-law index, and the resulting trends in the plots are discussed in detail. Also, the parameters of critical aerodynamic pressure and critical axially speed in different conditions are tabulated.}

Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help improve construction industry performance as well as meet new market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and consequently improve industry performance. On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to be particularly effective where a great deal of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of the actual training context. In order to address the problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences often faced on real construction projects. The proffered solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new working conditions associated with OSP practices. While the ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on a construction site, the environment predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers, construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety issues to occur; where the implications of which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go wrong’ and consequently allows users not only to ‘experience’ the resulting implications but also to reflect on those implications as part of the learning process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for the first development phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from industry, the research community, and academia from different EU countries, the data used in developing the prototype was constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the generalisability of results.}

abstract = {MR dampers have been widely applied in passive and semi-active vibration control over the past decades. The modeling of hysteretic behavior of structural components is a prerequisite for optimal performances of MR dampers and the predication of nonlinear dynamic responses of structures subjected to severe dynamic loads. However, it is hard to establish proper mathematical models for the nonlinear hysteretic behaviors of MR dampers in service due to the complexities of nonlinearities and the degradations of the construction materials. Consequently, it is strongly desired to develop model-free methodologies for the nonlinear hysteretic performance identification with no assumption on the nonlinear hysteretic models of MR dampers. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for this purpose. Firstly, the MR dampers are in the linear state when the structure is under the weak external excitations, the restoring force of the MR dampers is only provided by linear stiffness and viscous damping of MR dampers, the structural physical parameters can be estimated based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach. Then, MR dampers are in the nonlinear state when the structure is under the strong external excitations. The nonlinear restoring forces from MR dampers in a structure are treated as ‘unknown fictitious inputs’ to the corresponding structural systems without MR dampers. The recent Kalman filter with unknown input (KF-UI) algorithm developed by the authors is adopted for the simultaneous identification of the corresponding structural systems and the ‘unknown fictitious inputs’. No real information about the structure is needed, so the proposed method is capable of identifying hysteretic restoring forces of MR dampers by the direct use of partial structural dynamic response measurements, which are usually available from an employed structural health monitoring (SHM) system. To validate the performances of the proposed method, some numerical simulation examples of identifying nonlinear hysteretic restoring forces of MR dampers in different models are used.}

The growth rates up to 60μm/h in H2-CH4 mixtures and up to 105μm/h in Ar-H2-CH4 mixtures are achieved at high CH4 content, without adding nitrogen, still obtaining transparent crystals. The thermal conductivity k of the SCs in the temperature range of 220–420K is measured by a laser flash technique. High thermal conductivity k≈2300W/m⋅K at room temperature is found for the sample grown at low growth rate in H2-CH4, this value reducing to k≈2000W/mK for the material produced in high rate regime at 15% CH4. The spatial profiles of Hα and C2 line intensities in the plasma were determined with optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Soot formation at high CH4 contents is observed at the plasma border both for Ar-free and Ar-containing mixtures, the soot yield being roughly proportional to diamond growth rate. The soot temperature Ts, as measured with OES, is almost constant (3800±300K) in H2-CH4 mixtures over the all methane concentration range explored, while for Ar-containing plasma the Ts is even higher (4100–4200K) at [CH4]<10%, reducing, however, below 3800K in CH4-reach mixtures. Raman spectra of collected soot correspond to crystalline graphite with high density of defects. The estimated carbon conversion efficiency from CH4 precursor to the soot can exceed 10% and should be taken into account in overall carbon balance in the CVD process.}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for automatic 3D segmentation of the LV in LGE CMR images. Given myocardial contours in cine images as a priori knowledge, the framework initially propagates the a priori segmentation from cine to LGE images via 2D translational registration. Two meshes representing respectively endocardial and epicardial surfaces are then constructed with the propagated contours. After construction, the two meshes are deformed towards the myocardial edge points detected in both short-axis and long-axis LGE images in a unified 3D coordinate system. Taking into account the intensity characteristics of the LV in LGE images, we propose a novel parametric model of the LV for consistent myocardial edge points detection regardless of pathological status of the myocardium (infarcted or healthy) and of the type of the LGE images (short-axis or long-axis). We have evaluated the proposed framework with 21 sets of real patient and four sets of simulated phantom data. Both distance- and region-based performance metrics confirm the observation that the framework can generate accurate and reliable results for myocardial segmentation of LGE images. We have also tested the robustness of the framework with respect to varied a priori segmentation in both practical and simulated settings. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can greatly compensate variations in the given a priori knowledge and consistently produce accurate segmentations.}

However, medical imaging datasets that include expert manual segmentation are scarce as this step is time-consuming, and therefore expensive. Moreover, single-rater manual annotation is most often used in data-driven approaches making the network biased to only that single expert. In this work, we propose a CNN for brain extraction in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, that is fully trained with what we refer to as “silver standard” masks. Therefore, eliminating the cost associated with manual annotation. Silver standard masks are generated by forming the consensus from a set of eight, public, non-deep-learning-based brain extraction methods using the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) algorithm. Our method consists of (1) developing a dataset with “silver standard” masks as input, and implementing (2) a tri-planar method using parallel 2D U-Net-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (referred to as CONSNet). This term refers to our integrated approach, i.e., training with silver standard masks and using a 2D U-Net-based architecture. We conducted our analysis using three public datasets: the Calgary-Campinas-359 (CC-359), the LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Five performance metrics were used in our experiments: Dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, Hausdorff distance, and symmetric surface-to-surface mean distance. Our results showed that we outperformed (i.e., larger Dice coefficients) the current state-of-the-art skull-stripping methods without using gold standard annotation for the CNNs training stage. CONSNet is the first deep learning approach that is fully trained using silver standard data and is, thus, more generalizable. Using these masks, we eliminate the cost of manual annotation, decreased inter-/intra-rater variability, and avoided CNN segmentation overfitting towards one specific manual annotation guideline that can occur when gold standard masks are used. Moreover, once trained, our method takes few seconds to process a typical brain image volume using modern a high-end GPU. In contrast, many of the other competitive methods have processing times in the order of minutes.}

Objective
Very low birth weight (VLBW) survivors are at increased risk of neurological impairments that may persist into adolescence and adulthood. The aims of this study were to identify the most important clinical assessments that characterize differences between VLBW and control adolescents, and to look at the relationship between clinical assessments and the metabolites in in vivo MR spectra.
Methods
At 14–15 years of age, 54 VLBW survivors and 64 term controls were examined clinically. Several neuropsychological and motor assessments were performed. The magnetic resonance (MR) brain spectra were acquired from volumes localized in the left frontal lobe and contained mainly white matter.
Results
Probabilistic neural networks and support vector machines demonstrated that clinical assessments rendered a possibility of the classification of VLBW versus control adolescents. The most important clinical assessments in this classification were visual–motor integration, motor coordination, stroop test, full scale IQ, and grooved pegboard. Through the use of outer product analysis-partial least squares discriminant analysis on a subset of adolescents (n=36), the clinical assessments found to most strongly correlate with the spectral data were the global assessment scale, Wisconsin card sorting test, full scale IQ, grooved pegboard test, and motor coordination test. Clinical assessments that relate to spectral data may be especially dependent on an intact microstructure in frontal white matter.}

abstract = {This paper presents a Localized Active Contour Model (LACM) integrating an additional step of background intensity compensation. The region-based active contour models that use statistical intensity information are more sensitive to the high mean intensity distance between consecutive regions. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) this distance is great between the foreground and the background, hence it leads to an incorrect delineation of the target. In order to resolve this problem, an automatic process is introduced in our model for balancing the mean intensity distance between an image foreground and its background. The aim is to minimize the attraction effect of the active contour model to the undesired borderlines defined by these two mentioned image regions. By using this approach not only the obtained accuracy outperforms the traditional localized mean separation active contour model, but also it reduces the computation time of the segmentation task. In addition, this method was efficiently applied on automatic brain tumor segmentation in multimodal MRI data. The Hierarchical Centroid Shape Descriptor (HCSD) was used for detecting the region of interest i.e. abnormal tissue so as to automatically initialize the active contour. The validation of experiments was carried out on synthetic images and the quantitative evaluation was performed on the BRATS2012 database. Finally, the accuracy achieved by the proposed method was compared to the localized mean separation intensity, the localized Chan-Vese, the local Gaussian distribution fitting and the local binary fitting models by using the Dice coefficient, Sensitivity, Specificity and the Hausdorff distance. The computation time of the methods was also measured for comparison purposes. The obtained results show that the proposed model outperforms the accuracy of the selected state of the art methods. Moreover, it is also faster than the comparative methods in the medical image segmentation task.}

Chemical inhibition of laminar atmospheric methane/oxygen flames by trimethylphosphate over a range of equivalence ratio has been studied experimentally, using the heat flux method for measurement of burning velocity and molecular beam mass spectrometry for measurement of concentration profiles of both stable and labile species, and with numerical modeling using detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanisms. Concentrations of H and OH in flames with and without the inhibitor were obtained by measurements and modeling. The addition of the inhibitor reduces the maximum concentrations of H and OH (in the reaction zone) in the lean and rich flame. This reduction is much larger in the rich flame than in the lean one. The concentration profiles of PCSs—PO, PO2, HOPO, HOPO2, and H3PO4 were measured and simulated for rich and lean flames stabilized on a flat burner. According to flame speed measurements for inhibited CH4/air flames over a range of ϕ, the inhibition effectiveness Ei increases in the range of ϕ=0.8–1.2 and then decreases with a further increase of ϕ. The increase in Ei in the range ϕ=0.7–1.2 is attributed to a change of PCSs composition. The reduction in Ei for ϕ>1.2 can be explained by a decrease in the concentration of active PCSs due to an increase in the concentration of inactive species, such as CH3PO2 and other products of incomplete combustion of TMP. The inhibition effectiveness Ei versus ϕ correlates with change of H and OH concentration at addition of TMP in flame. Validation of the previously developed model for inhibition by PCSs has shown that in spite of some discrepancies it adequately describes many experimental results.}

abstract = {Automatic peripheral zone (PZ) and intra-prostatic urethra segmentation has clinical significance in analysis of prostate health management. It is interesting and much challenging task due to heterogeneous and inconsistent pixel intensities around prostate boundary and changes in a shape of the actual prostate capsule from patient to patient. The traditional methods of detection and delineation for glandular prostate gland using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) involve expertise of radiologists and it is expensive in terms of time and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel technique for automate segmentation of PZ of prostate and intra-prostatic urethra. The technique is based on radiomics extraction using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and segmentation using the self organizing maps (SOMs). The proposed framework is evaluated using 52 axial T2 weighted (T2w) MR images. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is calculated to measure the similarity between segmentation results and ground truth images. The proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional K-means (KM) clustering and fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering approaches of the segmentation. The proposed scheme is shown to be superior based on subjective and objective evaluation analysis. The average percentage of DSC for PZ and intra-prostatic urethra segmentation is 87.33% and 85.55%, respectively using the proposed technique.}

abstract = {Background
We proposed a novel classification system to distinguish among elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal controls (NC), based on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning.
Methods
The method employed 3D data of 178 subjects consisting of 97 NCs, 57 MCIs, and 24 ADs. First, all these 3D MR images were preprocessed with atlas-registered normalization to form an averaged volumetric image. Then, 3D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) was used to extract wavelet coefficients the volumetric image. The triplets (energy, variance, and Shannon entropy) of all subbands coefficients of 3D-DWT were obtained as feature vector. Afterwards, principle component analysis (PCA) was applied for feature reduction. On the basic of the reduced features, we proposed nine classification methods: three individual classifiers as linear SVM, kernel SVM, and kernel SVM trained by PSO with time-varying acceleration-coefficient (PSOTVAC), with three multiclass methods as Winner-Takes-All (WTA), Max-Wins-Voting, and Directed Acyclic Graph.
Results
The 5-fold cross validation results showed that the “WTA-KSVM+PSOTVAC” performed best over the OASIS benchmark dataset, with overall accuracy of 81.5% among all proposed nine classifiers. Moreover, the method “WTA-KSVM+PSOTVAC” exceeded significantly existing state-of-the-art methods (accuracies of which were less than or equal to 74.0%).
Conclusion
We validate the effectiveness of 3D-DWT. The proposed approach has the potential to assist in early diagnosis of ADs and MCIs.}

The proposed method can be interpreted as a two-stage Gibbs sampler composed of a particle filter, which is capable of estimating the unknown time-varying autoregressive coefficients, and a hybrid Monte Carlo method for estimating the unknown but constant distribution parameters of a symmetric alpha stable process. This method is an alternative to a recently published technique in which both the autoregressive coefficients and the distribution parameters are estimated jointly within a single sequential Monte Carlo framework—the single particle filter technique. The proposed method achieves lower error variances in estimating the distribution parameters compared with the single sequential Monte Carlo technique, and thus, successfully models symmetric impulsive signals.}

It was found that in O2/CO2, the fuel-NO yield per O2 consumption (YNO) is the lowest among the three atmospheres. All the tests in O2/CO2 show that YNO decreases with increasing combustion temperature. On the basis of the tests in N2 and Ar atmospheres at high temperature (1873K), the inhibition of fuel-NO by thermal-NO was revealed quantitatively. As the combustion temperature increases, the pulverized coal ignites earlier and the combustion durations get shorter. When at a low temperature (1273K), the combustion duration in the CO2 atmosphere is twice or three times longer than that in N2 and Ar atmospheres. When the temperature is above 1573K, the combustion durations in CO2 atmosphere are nearly the same as that of the other two atmospheres, indicating the high temperature would guarantee similar combustion characteristics between O2/CO2 and O2/N2. Furthermore, according to all the fuel-NO cumulative curves of the reaction processes, a cumulative percentage mathematical model (CPM) describing the fuel-NO release process in context of oxygen concentration, temperature, burnout rate, and atmosphere was proposed for comprehensive understanding of experimental results. As the combustion temperature and oxygen concentration increases, larger portion of fuel-NO is formed prior to coal burnout due to the enhanced char gasification and pyrolysis at high temperature. This phenomenon is enhanced in CO2 atmosphere, which further facilitates the reduction of fuel-NO.}

Panel zone in these connections consists of a middle panel, which is the vertical continuity plate, and two side panels, which are the webs of double sections of the column. Since the general behavior of these frames is governed by deformation of the middle panel, this panel is assumed as the primary one and the two side panels are assumed to be secondary. The column cover plates connecting the double sections and vertical continuity plate play an important role in providing compatibility of deformations. The new model proposed in this study is based on the previously developed models for the panel zones of connections in which the webs of beam and column are in the same plane, however, a number of refinements are introduced to capture the behavior of this type of connections. This quadri-linear model can be used for monotonic loading and accounts for both shear and bending deformations of panel zone. The results of this model are compared to those of finite element (FE) models verified by full scale experiments. The proposed model shows a good agreement, especially in elastic range, with the FE results. The results of FE analysis for important parameters affecting the panel zone behavior have also been compared to those obtained from the model in order to confirm the proposed model.}

Recombination centers, surface damage, and deep level defects created by the N2 and Ar discharges are the dominant mechanisms for device degradations.

Visible wavelength emission spectra are recorded by using a spectrometer coupled to a streak camera, and two photodetectors record intensity vs. time at AlO emission wavelengths of 486 and 514 nm. The streak camera allows recording of multiple time-resolved spectra at rates of 100 μs per spectrum. Aluminum particles ignited in mixtures of CO2/O2/Ar exhibited a burn time of about one half that of an atmosphere containing only a mixture of O2/Ar, holding the argon constant at 40%. In addition, as CO2 was substituted for O2 in successive experiments, a nonlinear relationship, as a function of the gas composition, was observed for ignition delay time and burn time. Within mixtures of H2O/O2/Ar, two distinct burning stages are visible for the combusting aluminum particles. As an increasing amount of H2O was substituted for O2 in separate tests, a second distinct burning stage developed. Spectroscopic data recorded during such experiments portray AlO emission during both combustion stages. Aluminum particles combusted in a mixture of H2O/Ar show burn times 2 to 5 times greater than those from CO2/O2/Ar mixtures, and ignition delay times 3 to 6 times greater.}

Properties of these composite systems were investigated under three point bending conditions using an instrumented drop weight impact system. Samples were studied from the viewpoint of the variations of impact load, deflection response, acceleration and absorbed energy. Development of the testing system in terms of components and acceleration response are discussed in detail. Methods of the impact load measurement using three different ways of acceleration response, piezoelectric load washer and conventional strain gage based load cell are discussed. Cement composites with two different fabric contents and four different drop heights of hammer (dropping mass) were tested. Experimental results indicate that for the same drop height, the stiffer beam type specimens have a lower ultimate deflection but a higher load carrying capacity than the plate type specimens. The maximum flexural stress and absorbed energy of composites increase with drop height. In beam specimens, complete fracture does not take place as cracks form and close due to rebound and significant microcracking in the form of radial fan cracking is observed, whereas interlaminar shear is the dominant failure mode in the plate specimens.}

abstract = {Background and objective
Accurate segmentation of prostate and its zones constitute an essential preprocessing step for computer-aided diagnosis and detection system for prostate cancer (PCa) using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). However, low signal-to-noise ratio and high variability of prostate anatomic structures are challenging for its segmentation using DWI. We propose a semi-automated framework that segments the prostate gland and its zones simultaneously using DWI.
Methods
In this paper, the Chan-Vese active contour model along with morphological opening operation was used for segmentation of prostate gland. Then segmentation of prostate zones into peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) was carried out using in-house developed probabilistic atlas with partial volume (PV) correction algorithm. The study cohort included MRI dataset of 18 patients (n = 18) as our dataset and methodology were also independently evaluated using 15 MRI scans (n = 15) of QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset. The atlas for zones of prostate gland was constructed using dataset of twelve patients of our patient cohort. Three-fold cross-validation was performed with 10 repetitions, thus total 30 instances of training and testing were performed on our dataset followed by independent testing on the QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard coefficient (JC), and accuracy were used for quantitative assessment of the segmentation results with respect to boundaries delineated manually by an expert radiologist. A paired t-test was performed to evaluate the improvement in zonal segmentation performance with the proposed PV correction algorithm.
Results
For our dataset, the proposed segmentation methodology produced improved segmentation with DSC of 90.76 ± 3.68%, JC of 83.00 ± 5.78%, and accuracy of 99.42 ± 0.36% for the prostate gland, DSC of 77.73 ± 2.76%, JC of 64.46 ± 3.43%, and accuracy of 82.47 ± 2.22% for the PZ, and DSC of 86.05 ± 1.50%, JC of 75.80 ± 2.10%, and accuracy of 91.67 ± 1.56% for the TZ. The segmentation performance for QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset was, DSC of 85.50 ± 4.43%, JC of 75.00 ± 6.34%, and accuracy of 81.52 ± 5.55% for prostate gland, DSC of 74.40 ± 1.79%, JC of 59.53 ± 8.70%, and accuracy of 80.91 ± 5.16% for PZ, and DSC of 85.80 ± 5.55%, JC of 74.87 ± 7.90%, and accuracy of 90.59 ± 3.74% for TZ. With the implementation of the PV correction algorithm, statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements were observed in all the metrics (DSC, JC, and accuracy) for both prostate zones, PZ and TZ segmentation.
Conclusions
The proposed segmentation methodology is stable, accurate, and easy to implement for segmentation of prostate gland and its zones (PZ and TZ). The atlas-based segmentation framework with PV correction algorithm can be incorporated into a computer-aided diagnostic system for PCa localization and treatment planning.}

A multi-technique approach has been adopted, combining Brillouin light scattering (BLS), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray reflectivity (XRR). The mass density of the films has been determined by XRR, while BLS has been adopted to test the elastic properties of the films. As the fraction of methane in the feed gas is increased, the deposited film shows both a higher phase velocity of the surface Rayleigh wave, and an increasing density, thus suggesting the synthesis of a harder material. This hardening effect has been attributed to the occurrence of a higher degree of structural order in the sp2 lattice, as suggested by Raman scattering measurements. These experimental findings are related to the different chemical composition of plasmas with different CH4/Ar ratios.}

The process of image fusion helps the radiologists in the precise diagnosis of several critical diseases and its treatment. In this paper, the proposed framework presents a fusion approach for multimodal medical images that utilize both the features extracted by the discrete ripplet transform (DRT) and pulse coupled neural network. The DRT having different features and a competent depiction of the image coefficients provides several directional high-frequency subband coefficients. The DRT decomposition can preserve more detailed information present in the reference images and further enhance the visualization of the fused images. Firstly, the DRT is applied to decompose the reference images into several low and high-frequency subimage coefficients that are fused by computing the novel sum modified Laplacian and novel modified spatial frequency motivated pulse coupled neural model. This model is used to preserve the redundant information also. Finally, fused images are reconstructed by applying the inverse DRT. The performance of the proposed fusion approach is validated by extensive simulation on the different CT-MR image datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides the better fused images in terms of visual quality along with the quantitative measures as compared to several existing fusion approaches.}

The FWWNN-AR model is a state-dependent autoregressive (SD-AR) model, which has its coefficients approximated by a set of Functional Weights Wavelet Neural Network (FWWNN). The FWWNN is an enhanced type of wavelet neural network comprising of five layers: input, wavelet, product, output and functional weight layer that computes the weights as function of inputs thus making the weights to vary with the inputs and to share the dynamics with the wavelet compartment. The FWWNN-AR model possesses both the advantages of the state-dependent AR model in the description of nonlinear dynamics using few nodes and of the FWWNN in functional approximation considering mutually the time and frequency spaces. It learns the nonlinear dynamics from three distinct levels: AR level, Wavelet compartment level and functional weights level. A Structured Nonlinear Parameter Optimization Method (SNPOM) is applied to estimate the FWWNN-AR model parameters. This learning approach divides the parameter search space into linear and nonlinear subspaces and centers the search in the nonlinear subspace, but at each iteration in the optimization process, a search in the nonlinear (or linear) subspace is executed on the basis of the estimated values just obtained in linear (or nonlinear) subspace. The search in the nonlinear subspace uses a method similar to the Levemberg–Marquardt Method (LMM), and the search in the linear subspace uses the Least Square Method (LSM). The proposed model is validated by comparing its performances and effectiveness with those achieved by some well known models on both generated and real nonlinear time series.}

The extracted ACL candidate is segmented iteratively by graph cuts with patient-specific shape constraints. Two shape constraints termed fence and neighbor costs are suggested such that the graph cuts prevent any leakage into adjacent regions with similar intensity. The segmented ACL label is refined by means of superpixel classification. Superpixel classification makes the segmented label propagate into missing inhomogeneous regions inside the ACL. In the experiments, the proposed method segmented the ACL with Dice similarity coefficient of 66.47±7.97%, average surface distance of 2.247±0.869, and root mean squared error of 3.538±1.633, which increased the accuracy by 14.8%, 40.3%, and 37.6% from the Boykov model, respectively.}

abstract = {The flame extinction processes and lifted flame stabilization features of nonpremixed flames issuing in diluted coflowing air were systematically examined under a wide range of aerodynamic conditions in order to reveal the competition between aerodynamics and dilution. Four diluents (CO2, N2, Ar, and CO2+Ar) were used in preparation for discriminating between the effects, namely, dilution, thermal action, and chemistry, induced by diluent addition. Flame extinction limits, ignition diagrams, liftoff height, and its associated apparent radius were investigated to provide key elements involved in lifted flame stabilization and extinction mechanisms with a diluted air stream. Flame extinction limits have been expressed as a 3D surface Eextinction in the physical space (Qdiluent/Qair, Uair, UCH4). This surface is composed of two parts, a pure extinction surface where flame extinction is necessarily attained from lifted flames, and a common surface between flame lifting and extinction where flame extinction is achieved directly from attached flames. This distinct behavior is due to the presence of the semithick burner rim that protects the flame base. The flame ignition diagrams confirm that the pure extinction surface is independent of UCH4 for flames initially lifted without dilution. Furthermore, (Qdiluent/Qair)/Kdiluent, where Kdiluent characterizes the capacity of a diluent to act on the flame destabilization process, has proved to be the affine parameter leading to a unified extinction surface for the tested chemically weak diluents. Moreover, by using (Qdiluent/Qair)/Kdiluent, liftoff height HL/HL∘ and flame radius RP/RP∘ reduced by the no-dilution measures merge to unique self-similar curves whatever the diluents and aerodynamic conditions. The key element is the flame leading-edge burning velocity, which was found to be identical for diluted flames when the diluents were added into the air stream in the relative proportions given by Kdiluent. In this way, it is possible to estimate flame behavior based on the results for CO2, once Kdiluent is known.}

abstract = {This study presents a sharpening image enhancement technique based on the Laplacian pyramid (LP) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve the visibility and segmentation of subtle organs. The technique utilizes the shape-invariant properties of LP and the SVD techniques to enhance the perceptual sharpness of an image. The sharpening enhancement of magnetic resonance images not only sharpens the edges, but also reduces the noise effect. The results are compared with state-of-art enhancement techniques. The performance measures like peak-signal-to noise (PSNR), mean structural similarity index (MSSIM), and absolute mean brightness error (AMBE) evaluates the improved performance of the proposed technique.}
