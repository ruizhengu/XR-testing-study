abstract = {In this work, Minkowski functionals (MFs) based brain to ventricle index is proposed to quantify the structural changes in Alzheimer’s MR brain images for severity detection. Initially, the original images (N=120) from MIRIAD and ADNI database, are skull stripped using morphology based method. The ventricles are segmented using localized region-based active contour method. These algorithms are validated using performance measures. The whole brain and the segmented ventricles are subjected to analysis using MFs. The Minkowski Formulation in 2D (MF2D) of whole brain, ventricle and ratio of brain to ventricle index are formulated. The prominent index is correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Results show that the correlation of the extracted whole brain (R=0.80) and the ventricle (R=0.82) with the experts ground truth is high. It is observed that the MF2D brain to ventricle index provide better discrimination of normal and abnormal subjects (p<0.0001). Its correlation with MMSE is observed to be high for normal and very high for Alzheimer subjects. Hence this index captures the structural changes and could be used to quantify the progression in neurodegenerative disorder such as AD.}

abstract = {The evaluation of cardiovascular velocities, their changes through the cardiac cycle and the consequent pressure gradients has the capacity to improve understanding of subject-specific blood flow in relation to adjacent soft tissue movements. Magnetic resonance time-resolved 3D phase contrast velocity acquisitions (4D flow) represent an emerging technology capable of measuring the cyclic changes of large scale, multi-directional, subject-specific blood flow. A subsequent evaluation of pressure differences in enclosed vascular compartments is a further step which is currently not directly available from such data. The focus of this work is to address this deficiency through the development of a novel simulation workflow for the direct computation of relative cardiovascular pressure fields. Input information is provided by enhanced 4D flow data and derived MR domain masking. The underlying methodology shows numerical advantages in terms of robustness, global domain composition, the isolation of local fluid compartments and a treatment of boundary conditions. This approach is demonstrated across a range of validation examples which are compared with analytic solutions. Four subject-specific test cases are subsequently run, showing good agreement with previously published calculations of intra-vascular pressure differences. The computational engine presented in this work contributes to non-invasive access to relative pressure fields, incorporates the effects of both blood flow acceleration and viscous dissipation, and enables enhanced evaluation of cardiovascular blood flow.}

abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new fault feature extraction approach based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and autoregressive (AR) model for roller bearings. AR model is an effective approach to extract the fault feature of the vibration signals and the fault pattern can be identified directly by the extracted fault features without establishing the mathematical model and studying the fault mechanism of the system. However, AR model can only be applied to stationary signals, while the fault vibration signals of a roller bearing are non-stationary. Aiming at this problem, in this paper, the EMD method is used as a pretreatment to decompose the non-stationary vibration signal of a roller bearing into a number of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components which are stationary, then the AR model of each IMF component can be established. The AR parameters and the remnant's variance of the AR models of each IMF components are regarded as the feature vectors. The Mahalanobis distance criterion function is used to identify the condition and fault pattern of a roller bearing. Experimental analysis results show that the roller bearing fault features can be extracted by the proposed approach effectively.}

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by a reduced ability to understand the emotions of other people. Increasing evidence indicates that children with ASD might not recognize or understand crucial nonverbal behaviors, which likely causes them to ignore nonverbal gestures and social cues, like facial expressions, that usually aid social interaction. We used an augmented reality (AR)-based video modeling (VM) storybook (ARVMS) to strengthen and attract the attention of children with ASD to nonverbal social cues because they have difficulty adjusting and switching their attentional focus. In this research, AR has multiple functions: it extends the social features of the story, but it also restricts attention to the most important parts of the videos. Evidence-based research shows that AR attracts the attention of children with ASD. However, few studies have combined AR with VM to train children with ASD to mimic facial expressions and emotions to improve their social skills. In addition, we used markerless natural tracking to teach the children to recognize patterns as they focused on the stable visual image printed in the storybook and then extended their attention to an animation of the story. After the three-phase (baseline, intervention, and maintenance) test data had been collected, the results showed that ARVMS intervention provided an augmented visual indicator which had effectively attracted and maintained the attention of children with ASD to nonverbal social cues and helped them better understand the facial expressions and emotions of the storybook characters.}

A procedure that defines behaviour factors to reduce the elastic spectrum for different types of structures, considering all possible types of failure, is needed. The paper presents a method for the definition of the behaviour factor (q-factor) for multi-storey steel frames, accounting for cumulative damage in structural components, by means of linear elastic time history analysis, of the Palmgren–Miner rule and of S–N (constant stress or strain range versus number of cycles to failure) curves extrapolated in the low-cycle fatigue range. This technique has been verified by a non-linear procedure that is different from the previous one, as a non-linear time history analysis with damage control has been performed instead of a linear one. The proposed approach can be useful in performance based design, since the linear procedure allows the definition of the q-factor corresponding to different level of damage or collapse prevention.}

abstract = {Earthquake emergencies require a variety of behavioral responses in order to ensure the safety of occupants, which is different from simply exiting a building in fire emergencies. This makes it more complex to train building occupants in order to acquire skills that align to best practices for immediate earthquake response and post-earthquake evacuation. In recent years, Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) and Serious Games (SGs) have become popular as training tools for earthquake emergencies. IVR SGs have been introduced to train individuals for specific building layouts or settings with fixed training objectives. However, the lack of flexibility in existing IVR SGs makes it challenging to have widespread uptake as trainees require different training objectives, pedagogical strategies, context, and content. As a result, the effectiveness of IVR SGs training is jeopardized if the customization ability is limited. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a customization framework for IVR SGs suited to earthquake emergency training, using the concept of adaptive game-based learning. Trainees can receive training in context by customizing virtual environments, storylines, and teaching methods. A case study was undertaken to validate the proposed framework. Results showed the potential to carry out the customization process with ease, to generate a customized training experience, and to deliver the customized training for optimum learning.}

To assess the method, a virtual reality scenario based on the conditions in a hotel room during the MGM Grand fire in 1980 was created, and 55 naïve participants were exposed to it. Their behavior was later compared to that of the survivors of the real fire. The results show that the virtual environment made approximately 50% of the participants feel urgency due to the emergency and act on it. A comparison to the data from the MGM Grand fire confirmed that real life behavior can be observed in the virtual environment, although the frequencies of actions performed were lower in the virtual reality experiments.}

MR imaging sequences included a T2-weighted sequence and the arterial spin-labeling technique, flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery with an extra radiofrequency pulse (FAIRER). Areas of viable and non-viable tumor were estimated based on the spin echo imaging sequences. Perfusion images were obtained from a magnitude subtraction of the labeled from the unlabeled images from the FAIRER sequence. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed in muscle, viable tumor regions, and necrotic tumor regions. Mean ROI signal intensities for viable tumor vs. muscle and necrotic tumor vs. muscle were compared using the student t-test. Spin echo imaging demonstrated tumors in 30 of 34 thighs. Perfusion images were successfully obtained in all cases. Mean ROIs were significantly greater in regions of viable tumor compared to those in muscle (p < 0.001). Mean ROIs were significantly less in regions of necrotic tumor compared to those in muscle (p < 0.001). Virus-associated VX2 tumors serve a good model for evaluating arterial spin labeling technique.

abstract = {Route turning is one of the most essential and ubiquitous physical features in the complex building environment. Under the influence of route turning, evacuees’ approaching perspective to an emergency sign could vary, affecting their information perception and behavioral compliance during the evacuation. Although conventional simulation methods assess the effectiveness of the emergency sign in the visible region, they fail to consider evacuees’ wayfinding behaviors and interaction with the emergency sign. It remains unclear whether the route turning angle affects evacuees’ compliance for detecting and responding to the emergency sign. To investigate such an influence, a virtual-reality-based method for assessing human evacuation behaviors in building fire evacuations was proposed. In this study, two evacuation routes with different turning angles in a shopping mall were created and implemented in a virtual-reality environment, and 67 subjects participated in the immersive virtual-reality-based experiment. All participants took the two routes to find the nearest exit for evacuation in a fire event, aiming to evaluate the effect of the route turning angle on the evacuation process. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. Next, statistical analyses were conducted on evacuation results, information perception, and evacuation performance of the participants. The results indicated the route turning angle significantly affected participants' behavioral compliance with emergency signs. The results also suggested the route turning angle was influential on participants’ information perception and evacuation performance. Besides, a significant effect on rotation change, wayfinding pause, and speed deviation were observed. This study validates the effectiveness of investigating evacuees’ interaction with emergency signs using virtual-reality technology and has potential implications for complex building path planning and evacuation simulation modeling.}

The computational efficiency of the proposed GA is improved with the absorption of the selection stage into the crossover and mutation operations. Crossover and mutation are also made adaptive to the fitness values such that their probabilities need not be user-specified. Instead of using a sufficiently number of generations or a pre-determined fitness value, the algorithm termination criterion is formulated on the basis of a statistical hypothesis test, thus enhancing the performance of the parameter identification. Experimental test data of the damper displacement and force are used to verify the proposed approach with satisfactory parameter identification results.}

abstract = {Purpose
Improved integration and use of preoperative imaging during surgery hold significant potential for enhancing treatment planning and instrument guidance through surgical navigation. Despite its prevalent use in diagnostic settings, MR imaging is rarely used for navigation in spine surgery. This study aims to leverage MR imaging for intraoperative visualization of spine anatomy, particularly in cases where CT imaging is unavailable or when minimizing radiation exposure is essential, such as in pediatric surgery.
Methods
This work presents a method for deformable 3D-2D registration of preoperative MR images with a novel intraoperative long-length tomosynthesis imaging modality (viz., Long-Film [LF]). A conditional generative adversarial network is used to translate MR images to an intermediate bone image suitable for registration, followed by a model-based 3D-2D registration algorithm to deformably map the synthesized images to LF images. The algorithm’s performance was evaluated on cadaveric specimens with implanted markers and controlled deformation, and in clinical images of patients undergoing spine surgery as part of a large-scale clinical study on LF imaging.
Results
The proposed method yielded a median 2D projection distance error of 2.0 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.1–3.3 mm) and a 3D target registration error of 1.5 mm (IQR: 0.8–2.1 mm) in cadaver studies. Notably, the multi-scale approach exhibited significantly higher accuracy compared to rigid solutions and effectively managed the challenges posed by piecewise rigid spine deformation. The robustness and consistency of the method were evaluated on clinical images, yielding no outliers on vertebrae without surgical instrumentation and 3% outliers on vertebrae with instrumentation.
Conclusions
This work constitutes the first reported approach for deformable MR to LF registration based on deep image synthesis. The proposed framework provides access to the preoperative annotations and planning information during surgery and enables surgical navigation within the context of MR images and/or dual-plane LF images.}

abstract = {This article focus on modelling of ageing effects on crack-bridging behaviour of AR-glass multifilament yarns embedded in cement-based matrix. In the first step, age-dependent changes in the crack-bridging behaviour of AR-glass multifilament yarns were investigated at the meso and micro levels. Two cementitious matrices were considered where the binder contained Portland cement clinker and ground granulated blast furnace slag cement, respectively. Mechanical characteristics of the bond between matrix and multifilament yarns after accelerated ageing were measured by means of double-sided yarn pullout tests. In these tests the multifilament yarns bridged a single crack in the matrix arising in a notched area of the specimen. Losses in performance with increasing age differed widely depending on matrix material composition. The essential cause of such losses was discovered to be the microscopic densification of the fibre-to-matrix interface. This led to increased bond intensity and restricted slip-ability of the filaments. Subsequently, these micro-structural phenomena were related to the mesoscopic material behaviour by means of a phenomenological bond model. This cross-linkage model describes the crack-bridging effect of the entire multifilament yarn at the single filament level. According to the model, each filament possesses a specific deformation length depending on its position in the cross-section of the yarn. This deformation length depends on bond characteristics between single filament and cementitious matrix, which vary with age. Characteristic values of the model were computed from load-crack width curves obtained from the yarn pullout tests. The changes in the microstructure were represented by the characteristic values of the model.}

abstract = {This paper presents a closed stochastic solution for the calibration of see-through head-mounted displays (STHMD) for Augmented Reality. An Augmented Reality system (ARS) is based on several components that are affected by stochastic and random errors. One important component is the tracking system. The flock of birds (FOB) tracking system was tested for consistency in position and orientation outputs by establishing constraints that the system was required to meet. The tests for position and orientation were separated to derive uncorrelated quality measures. The tests are self-controlling and do not require any other measuring device. In addition, the image coordinate accuracy also had to be determined to complete the stochastic description of the calibration problem. Based on this stochastic model, different mathematical models were tested to determine whether or not they fit the stochastic model. An overview of different calibration approaches for optical see-through displays is given and a quantitative comparison of the different models is made based on the derived accuracy information.}

The acoustic model of a multi-layered panel containing MR fluid is developed analytically using the elastic model with complex modulus for the MR layer. The STL of the panel is then calculated based on the analytical model. Experimental work comprises two major parts: rheology tests and acoustic (STL) measurements. Rheology tests are conducted using a MCR300 rheometer. Characteristics of the MR fluid (loss/storage moduli) are determined in magnetic fields where current varied within 0.2–1.8Amp. Acoustic measurements are made with a special impedance tube equipped with a magnetic chamber designed and fabricated to apply the field on the MR fluid. Test samples are subjected to two external fields of 145mT and 340mT. Analytical results show that increasing the magnetic field from 0.2A to 1.8A raises the STL to 30dB for a wide range of frequencies (f<3kHz). However, in some frequencies, especially those above 3kHz, increasing the field leads to a decline in the STL values. In order to validate the analytical model, theoretical results are compared with those obtained from the experiments. Good agreement is found especially at frequencies below 2500Hz.}

Experiments were performed at nearly isothermal conditions, by heavily diluting reactive mixtures in argon, in an attempt to mitigate temperature changes from exothermic chemical reactions. This technique allows experimental results to be interpreted from a perspective that plasma and thermal (neutral) heat release effects are decoupled, essentially isolating the effects of the plasma-chemistry and its influence on the neutral-chemistry. Results showed no thermal reaction until 860 K, at which point hydrogen was rapidly consumed within the flow residence time associated with the reactor. With the plasma discharge, the onset of oxidation was extended to lower temperatures (T < 860 K), while exhibiting a steady increase in the rate of oxidation starting from 470 K, and eventually consuming all the initial hydrogen by 800 K. Absolute measurements of OH mole fraction reveal that at conditions well below the dominance of the thermal chain-branched chemistry (at T = 668 K), the plasma induced a chain-propagating effect on OH formation, which was entirely confined to the boundaries of the plasma discharge section of the reactor. Furthermore, temporal measurements were also performed, showing that the extent of OH formation and subsequently its global effect on the fuel consuming chemistry can be manipulated based on the plasma perturbation timescale (i.e., the time scale at which the high-voltage pulses are administered to the reactive flow to generate the plasma discharge). Experimental results are compared to modeling calculations and show relatively good agreement, with the model predicting similar kinetic trends as a function of temperature. These results demonstrate new insight into the kinetics governing plasma-assisted combustion, and provide new experimental data to facilitate the development and validation of PAC-specific kinetic mechanisms.}

abstract = {Motion artifacts on magnetic resonance (MR) images degrade image quality and thus negatively affect clinical and research scanning. Considering the difficulty in preventing patient motion during MR examinations, the identification of motion artifact has attracted significant attention from researchers. We propose an automatic method for the evaluation of motion corrupted images using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Deep CNNs has been used widely in image classification tasks. While such methods require a significant amount of annotated training data, a scarce resource in medical imaging, the transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches allow us to use a smaller amount of data. Here we selected four renowned architectures, initially trained on Imagenet contest dataset, to fine-tune. The models were fine-tuned using patches from an annotated dataset composed of 68 T1-weighted volumetric acquisitions from healthy volunteers. For training and validation 48 images were used, while the remaining 20 images were used for testing. Each architecture was fine-tuned for each MR axis, detecting the motion artifact per patches from the three orthogonal MR acquisition axes. The overall average accuracy for the twelve models (three axes for each of four architecture) was 86.3%. As our goal was to detect fine-grained corruption in the image, we performed an extensive search on lower layers from each of the four architectures, since they filter small regions in the original input. Experiments showed that architectures with fewer layers than the original ones reported the better results for image patches with an overall average accuracy of 90.4%. The accuracies per architecture were similar so we decided to explore all four architectures performing a result consensus. Also, to determine the probability of motion artifacts presence on the whole acquisition a combination of the three axes were performed. The final architecture consists of an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier combining all models from the four shallower architectures, which overall acquisition-based accuracy was 100.0%. The proposed method generalization was tested using three different MR data: (1) MR image acquired in epilepsy patients (93 acquisitions); (2) MR image presenting susceptibility artifact (22 acquisitions); and (3) MR image acquired from different scanner vendor (20 acquisitions). The achieved acquisition-based accuracy on generalization tests (1) 90.3%, (2) 63.6%, and (3) 75.0%) suggests that domain adaptation is necessary. Our proposed method can be rapidly applied to large amounts of image data, providing a motion probability p∈[0,1] per acquisition. This method output can be used as a scale to identify the motion corrupted images from the dataset, thus minimizing the time spent on visual quality control.}

The system first utilizes two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT) for extracting features from the images. After feature vector normalization, probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. The reduced features are applied to the classifier to categorize MR images into normal and abnormal. This scheme uses an AdaBoost algorithm with random forests as its base classifier. Three benchmark MR image datasets, Dataset-66, Dataset-160, and Dataset-255, have been used to validate the proposed system. A 5×5-fold stratified cross validation scheme is used to enhance the generalization capability of the proposed scheme. Simulation results are compared with the existing schemes and it is observed that the proposed scheme outperforms others in all the three datasets.}

A functional including Mumford–Shah segmentation and optical flow based dense motion estimation is approximated using the phase-field technique. The minimizer of the functional provides an optimum motion field and edge set by considering both spatial and temporal discontinuities. Exploiting calculus of variation principles, multiple partial differential equations associated with the Euler–Lagrange equations of the functional are extracted, first. Next, the finite element method is used to discretize the resulting PDEs for numerical solution. Several simulation runs are used to test the convergence and the parameter sensitivity of the method. It is further applied to a comprehensive set of clinical data in order to compare with conventional cascade methods. Developmental constraints are identified as memory usage and computational complexities, which may be resolved utilizing sparse matrix manipulations and similar techniques. Based on the results of this study, joint segmentation and motion estimation outperforms previously reported cascade approaches especially in segmentation. Experimental results substantiated that the proposed method extracts the motion field and the edge set more precisely in comparison with conventional cascade approaches. This superior result is the consequence of simultaneously considering the discontinuity in both motion field and image space and including consequent frames (usually five) in our joint process functional.}

A self-tuning (ST) fusion filter is presented when MPs of AR signal, sensor biases, missing measurement rates and measurement noise variances in the system model are unknown. First, MPs of AR signal and sensor biases are identified by using a multi-dimensional recursive extended least squares (MRELS) algorithm. Further, distributed fusion estimates of MPs of AR signal are obtained by using a matrix-weighted optimal fusion estimation algorithm in the sense of linear unbiased minimum variance (LUMV). Then, receiving measurement rates and measurement noise variances are identified by correlation functions. Finally, substituting the identified parameters into the proposed optimal filtering algorithms, a matrix-weighted self-tuning (ST) fusion filtering algorithm is obtained. An example verifies the effectiveness of algorithms.}

A detailed and immersive 3D model of the plant allows the operators understanding the details of both equipment and operating conditions. The complex dynamic behavior and control strategies of the process can be reproduced with a highly detailed 3D virtual environment by employing and coupling a dynamic process simulator and a dynamic real-time accident simulator. The AVR feature allows enhancing and improving the understanding and skill of field operators by letting them know the process operating conditions that dynamically change within the plant section where they work. The same can be said of process dynamics in case of abnormal and accident conditions. The positive outcome of this operator-training tool consists in increasing the reliability, cost effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and safety of the process.}

abstract = {Full-scale experiments are carried out on a single-degree-of-freedom mass that is equipped with a hybrid base isolation system. The isolator consists of a set of four friction pendulum system (FPS) bearings and a magnetorheological (MR) damper. The 13,620 kg mass and its hybrid isolation system are subjected to various intensities of near- and far-fault earthquakes on a large shake table. The proposed fuzzy controller uses feedback from displacement or acceleration transducers attached to the structure to modulate resistance of the semi-active damper to motion. Results from several types of passive and semi-active control strategies are summarized and compared. The study shows that a combination of FPS bearings and an adjustable MR damper can provide robust control of vibration for a large full-scale structure undergoing a wide variety of seismic loads. Low power consumption, real-time feedback control, and fail-safe operation are validated in this study. A combination of the FPS bearings and the MR damper appears to offer significant possibilities for reduction of displacement and acceleration due to seismic load. A neuro-fuzzy model is used to represent behavior of the damper for various displacement, velocity, and voltage combinations that are obtained from a series of laboratory evaluation tests. Modeling of the FPS bearings is carried out with a nonlinear analytical equation and neuro-fuzzy training. Numerical simulation using neuro-fuzzy models of the MR damper and FPS bearings predict the response of the hybrid base isolation system very well. Results show that dynamic behavior of the FPS bearings and MR damper can be successfully estimated using these neuro-fuzzy models.}

abstract = {Objective
We aimed to assess whether individuals accept performing upper limb exercises using immersive VR games, indicated by behavioral intention, and the roles of age, self-efficacy, and technology acceptance model (TAM) constructs in the acceptance.
Methods
Sixty healthy participants aged 20–79 years were examined for their perceptions and acceptance of VR game-based exercises using a questionnaire. Participants were instructed to perform upper limb exercises by playing five immersive VR games in a laboratory. A theoretical model delineated the roles of the focal constructs in the acceptance was formulated and tested using path analysis.
Results
At least 76.6% of participants (n = 46) expressed their intention to perform upper limb exercises through immersive VR games in the future. Overall, the model explained 83% variance in behavioral intention. Significant associations were observed, as follows. Age was positively associated with perceived usefulness (β = 0.27, p = 0.01), which positively influenced attitude (β = 0.64, p < 0.001); in turn, attitude positively affected behavioral intention (β = 0.84, p < 0.001). Moreover, self-efficacy positively affected perceived ease of use (β = 0.84, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Factors such as age, perceived usefulness, attitude, and self-efficacy were found to play significant roles in the acceptance of immersive VR games for upper limb exercises. In the future, strategies should be devised to meet the requirements of end users of different ages and promote usefulness, attitude, and self-efficacy in performing upper limb exercises through immersive VR games.}

This converts the global probability distribution to a probability distribution of two regions only resulting in partial loss of information. The brain regions (white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) have closely defined gray values, which require the intensity difference information for thresholding. So we propose a novel automated absolute intensity difference based (AIDB) technique for optimal MR brain image thresholding using adaptive coral reef optimization (ACRO). The basic idea is to extract the intensity difference information of the brain image from the 2D histogram matrix. A first-hand objective function, depending on the classical between class variance concepts, is investigated, which is maximized by ACRO. The key achievements of our technique are (i) improved thresholding results, (ii) obtaining more homogenous regions of the image and (iii) obtaining more precise shape of the edges. The proposed technique is tested with one hundred slices of the axial T2 – weighted MR brain images of Harvard medical dataset. The Otsu method for multilevel thresholding using the 2D histogram is considered for a comparison. Several performance measures are considered for the evaluation. It is observed that our technique outperforms the other standard methods.}

Accurately distinguishing and classifying brain tumor types accurately is crucial for patient treatment and survival in clinical practice. However, existing computer-aided diagnostic pipelines are inadequate for practical medical use due to tumor complexity. In this study, we curated a multi-centre brain tumor dataset that includes various clinical brain tumor data types, including segmentation and classification annotations, surpassing previous efforts. To enhance brain tumor segmentation accuracy, we propose a new segmentation method: HSA-Net. This method utilizes the Shared Weight Dilated Convolution module (SWDC) and Hybrid Dense Dilated Convolution module (HDense) to capture multi-scale information while minimizing parameter count. The Effective Multi-Dimensional Attention (EMA) and Important Feature Attention (IFA) modules effectively aggregate task-related information. We introduce a novel clinical brain tumor computer-aided diagnosis pipeline (CAD) that combines HSA-Net with pipeline modification. This approach not only improves segmentation accuracy but also utilizes the segmentation mask as an additional channel feature to enhance brain tumor classification results. Our experimental evaluation of 3327 real clinical data demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 86.85 % for segmentation and a classification accuracy of 95.35 %. We also validated the effectiveness of our proposed method using the publicly available BraTS dataset.}

abstract = {Background
Flight anxiety and the fear-related avoidance draw serious personal and financial negative consequences. Although classical exposure techniques for flight anxiety are widely used, they involve significant limits. Efforts to develop the benefits and access to evidence-based psychotherapies have led to a new method of delivering exposure technique, namely virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). Until now, there has been no meta-analysis which assumed as a primary objective the analysis of VRET effectiveness in flight anxiety.
Methods
The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of VRET interventions for flight anxiety compared to various control conditions, at post-test and follow-up. We conducted a quantitative review of 11 randomized studies, we examined potential moderators of the efficacy of interventions and we investigated the presence and the degree of publication bias.
Results
Results pointed out significant overall efficiency of VRET in flight anxiety at post-test and follow-up. Analysis highlighted the superiority of VRET vs. control conditions at post-test and follow-up and the superiority of VRET vs. classical evidence-based interventions at post-test and follow-up. Results revealed similar efficacy between VRET and exposure based interventions at post-test, and showed better treatment gains over time when using VRET vs. exposure based interventions. Moderation analyses revealed that low quality trials, with smaller and younger samples led to a larger effect size of VRET for flight anxiety. Also, outcome types, the number of exposure sessions and follow-up intervals were significant moderators of the efficiency of VRET in this disorder.
Conclusions
The present meta-analysis supports the efficiency of VRET in flight anxiety and encourages the use of this type of exposure both in clinical practice and research field.}

It therefore has the potential to be a valuable research tool for studies in human–environment interaction, such as building usability studies and post- as well as pre-occupancy building evaluation in architectural research and practice. In order to fully understand VR as a valid environmental representation, it is essential to examine to what extent not only user cognition and behavior, but also users' experiences are analogous in real and virtual environments. This work presents a multi-method approach with two studies that investigated the correspondence of building users' experience in a real conference center and a highly-detailed virtual model of the same building as well as a third study that virtually implemented systematic redesigns to the existing building layout. In the context of reporting users' experiential building evaluations, this article discusses the potential, prerequisites and opportunities for the implementation of virtual environments as an empirical research tool in the field of human–environment interaction. Based on quantitative data, few statistically significant differences between ratings of the real and the virtual building were found; however analyses based on qualitative data revealed differences relating to atmospherics. The main conclusion of this article is that VR has a strong potential to be used as an empirical research tool in psychological and architectural research and that future studies could supplement behavioral validation.}

abstract = {Laminar flame speed (SL) measurements of stoichiometric propane in an oxygen-argon oxidizer were performed in a shock tube at unburned-gas temperatures of 296–1234 K and near-atmospheric pressures. Non-intrusive laser-induced breakdown is used to ignite expanding flames following the reflected-shock passage. Flame propagation is recorded using schlieren imaging in a recently implemented side-wall imaging flame test section (SWIFT). In a refined approach to account for flame distortion and the slight residual motion of the post-reflected-shock gas, an area-averaged formulation of the linear-curvature model (the AA-LC model) is derived for use extrapolating flame data to zero stretch. Measured SL values extracted using the AA-LC model closely agree with previous experimental measurements performed in a conventional kinetics shock tube (CKST) using much smaller flame kernels, providing evidence of the earlier data having been ignition affected. Below the chemistry-affected limit of 1050 K, experimental SL values fall in the range of values simulated with the detailed AramcoMech 3.0 kinetic mechanism and propane-specific mechanisms from NUIG and San Diego but exhibit a stronger temperature dependence than predicted by the mechanisms. Over the wide temperature range of the present data, the ubiquitous power-law form of empirical fit is shown to be inadequate for capturing the SL temperature dependence; a non-Arrhenius form is shown to perform favorably. The uncertainties of flame speed measurements performed in the SWIFT average 3.0% and 4.4% for experiments performed under static and post-reflected-shock conditions, respectively, a reduction from the 5.8% average uncertainty of CKST experiments. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of experimental capabilities for high-temperature flame speed measurements. The present results illustrate the potential value of the shock-tube flame speed method to provide measurements useful for informing kinetic model tuning and validation at conditions for which experimental data were not previously obtainable.}

The simultaneous enhancements in conductivity and near band edge emissions (NBEs), accompanied by a suppression of deep level emissions (DLEs), suggest a passivation effect of the Ar plasma. The dependences on plasma treatment time showed correlations between the DLE and Hall mobility as well as between carrier concentration and the NBE. The results suggested that not only radiative defects but also nonradiative defects could be passivated. The plasma treatment also led to a distortion and deterioration of crystalline structure, as well as damage on the surface, which may account for the decrease in Hall mobility for long treatment time. The incorporation of hydrogen into the ZnO film after Ar plasma treatment has been confirmed using a secondary ions mass spectroscopy. The hydrogen incorporation could be the most probable factor accounting for the significant improvement in optoelectrical properties of ZnO thin film. In addition to the role of passivant, hydrogen atoms can also act as shallow donors, contributing to the eventual increase in carrier concentration.}

A MR damper was also designed in proper size suitable for the control of the model. The experiment was performed in the way in which three piers were fixed on three shaking tables with 30% of El-centro earthquake wave, and a control device was placed on the lower part of its upper deck for horizontal control. As for control algorithms, Lyapunov and Clipped-optimal control algorithms were applied. The effectiveness of the semi-active control with MR damper for the asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge was measured under five control conditions: Un-control, Passive-off, Passive-on, Lyapunov Control, Clipped-optimal Control. The experiment showed that the semi-active control applying Lyapunov and Clipped-optimal algorithms effectively increased controllability almost in double, and decreased displacement 75% compared with the condition of passive-off.

Then a new non-linear hysteretic model is proposed to model the mechanical behavior of the MR damper and the model parameters are identified from test data. An experimental method, as well as a set of testing setups with the MR damper for longitudinal seismic response reduction of a SDOF generalized system representing the fundamental longitudinal mode of suspension bridge, is developed. Finally, the seismic response reduction experiment subject to three kinds of earthquake excitations, including the Pingsheng Bridge earthquake wave, the El-Centro wave and the Taft wave, is carried out, and nine control cases, including uncontrolled, six passive control schemes with different input currents and two semi-active Bang–Bang control schemes, are tested. The results verify that the seismic response reduction experimental method is feasible and the good performance of seismic longitudinal response reduction of the suspension bridge can be achieved by MR damper. It is also shown that the passive control with optimum input current outperforms the semi-active Bang–Bang controls.}

Test conditions were optimized to suppress the sensitivity of OH to interfering reactions after the induction time, using dilute and extremely lean mixtures at these temperatures. The strong Q1(5) transition in the A-X(0,0) band of OH was used as the probing wavelength for the diagnostic. Calibration measurements were performed prior to the experiments to estimate the effects of pressure shift and collision broadening on the absorption coefficient of OH for each of the bath gas species, which enabled a reduction in the uncertainty in the absorption cross-section of OH. Aided by the calibrated and improved OH diagnostic, the reaction rate constants were determined at high temperatures, with low scatter, and tight uncertainty bounds. The measured rate constants also agree with the extrapolation of previous investigations at lower temperatures.

An online questionnaire was developed and distributed on popular websites to collect data, and 1028 usable responses are collected from the players of Pokémon Go in Taiwan. The eleven hypotheses and control variables were validated by using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. Among the antecedents of the game’s stickiness in the model, the flow and satisfaction were found to have strong direct effects. The effects of control variables (age, gender, platform, game experience, and in-app expense) on the stickiness were significant as well. Moreover, telepresence, challenge, perceived control, curiosity, and concentration all have direct influences on the flow. Only perceived currency and responsiveness were found to have a direct impact on players’ satisfaction. The model demonstrated good explanatory power for flow and stickiness in the context of location-based AR game.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of controlling quarter-vehicle semi-active suspension systems. Presently, the suspension system involves a magnetorheologic MR damper featuring a hysteretic behavior captured through Dahl model. The control problem is dealt with backstepping control design. First, an observer is designed to get online estimates of the hysteresis internal state. Then, an adaptive state-feedback controller, that ensures a tight regulation of the chassis vertical position, is designed assuming all internal state variables to be accessible to measurements. Finally, an adaptive output-feedback controller is obtained combining the previous designed observer and state-feedback controller. It is formally established that the output-feedback controller asymptotically meets its control objectives. This theoretical result is confirmed by several simulation tests.}

abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)–magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents an emerging method for the prediction of biomarker responses in cancer. However, DCE images remain difficult to analyze and interpret. Although pharmacokinetic approaches, which involve multi-step processes, can provide a general framework for the interpretation of these data, they are still too complex for robust and accurate implementation. Therefore, statistical data analysis techniques were recently suggested as another valid interpretation strategy for DCE–MRI. In this context, we propose a spectral clustering approach for the analysis of DCE–MRI time–intensity signals. This graph theory-based method allows for the grouping of signals after spatial transformation. Subsequently, these data clusters can be labeled following comparison to arterial signals. Here, we have performed experiments with simulated (i.e., generated via pharmacokinetic modeling) and clinical (i.e., obtained from patients scanned during prostate cancer diagnosis) data sets in order to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of this kind of unsupervised and non-parametric approach.}

The algorithm corrects the tissue inhomogeneity with a novel method that produces good results with low computation time and complexity. The estimated bias field is modelled as a multiplicative noise and uses low-pass filtering to obtain smoothness of the form. To reduce the impact of the background low-level intensity on the object high-level intensity, the background is remodified. The inhomogeneity correction method is validated by comparing its results with those of a simulated ground-truth image. In the segmentation procedure, fuzzy c-mean clustering is used. The segmentation results of the automatic algorithm are comparable to the medical-specialist annotations with a similarity index above 0.91, indicating an excellent result of the proposed automatic processing.}

abstract = {The conventional two dimensional (2-D) histogram based Otsu’s method gives unreliable results while considering multilevel thresholding of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, because the edges of the brain regions are not preserved due to the local averaging process involved. Moreover, some of the useful pixels present inside the off-diagonal regions are ignored in the calculation. This article presents an evolutionary gray gradient algorithm (EGGA) for optimal multilevel thresholding of brain MR images. In this paper, more edge information is preserved by computing 2-D histogram based gray gradient. The key to our success is the use of the gray gradient information between the pixel values and the pixel average values to minimize the information loss. In addition, the speed improvement is achieved. Theoretical formulations are derived for computing the maximum between class variance from the 2-D histogram of the brain image. A first-hand fitness function is suggested for the EGGA. A novel adaptive swallow swarm optimization (ASSO) algorithm is introduced to optimize the fitness function. The performance of ASSO is validated using twenty three standard Benchmark test functions. The performance of ASSO is better than swallow swarm optimization (SSO). The optimum threshold value is obtained by maximizing the between class variance using ASSO. Our method is tested using the standard axial T2 − weighted brain MRI database of Harvard medical education using 100 slices. Performance of our method is compared to the Otsu’s method based on the one dimensional (1-D) and the 2-D histogram. The results are also compared among four different soft computing techniques. It is observed that results obtained using our method is better than the other methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Benefits of our method are – (i) the EGGA exhibits better objective function values; (ii) the EGGA provides us significantly improved results; and (iii) more computational speed is achieved.}

The aim of the proposed PLCSF is to assist clinicians in radiotherapy treatment planning. The initial processing of MRI data in PLCSF includes cropping of region of interest; reduction of artefacts and detection of the throat region for the location prior. Further, modified fuzzy c-means clustering is developed to robustly separate candidate cancer pixels from other tissue types. In addition, region-based level set method is evolved to ensure spatial smoothness for the final segmentation boundary after noise removal using non-linear and morphological filtering. Validation study of PLCSF on 102 axial MRI slices demonstrate mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.79 and mean modified Hausdorff distance of 2.2mm when compared with manual segmentations. Comparison of PLCSF with other algorithms validates the robustness of the PLCSF. Inter- and intra-variability calculations from manual segmentations suggest that PLCSF can help to reduce the human subjectivity.}

The electroluminescent features were examined to compare the rate of degradation in the devices with thermally evaporated Al cathodes and ion-beam-assisted Al cathodes. The dense and highly packed Al cathode effectively prevents the permeation of H2O and O2 through pinhole defects, which results in retarding dark spot growth. Employing thin Al buffer layer diminished Ar+ ion-induced damages in phenyl-substituted poly-p-phenylene-vinylene (Ph-PPVs) and limited permeation against H2O and O2. The interface between Al and Ph-PPV may be modified in IBAD case, even though buffered Al layer was deposited to 30nm by thermal evaporation prior to Ar+ ion beam irradiation. It is believed that the buffered Al film cannot screen the Ar+ ions or Al atoms wholly due to the existence of pinholes or non-deposited regions among the columnar structures.}

abstract = {This paper presents a statistical approach to aggregating speed and phase (directional) information for vascular segmentation of phase contrast magnetic resonance angiograms (PC-MRA). Rather than relying on speed information alone, as done by others and in our own work, we demonstrate that including phase information as a priori knowledge in a Markov random field (MRF) model can improve the quality of segmentation. This is particularly true in the region within an aneurysm where there is a heterogeneous intensity pattern and significant vascular signal loss. We propose to use a Maxwell–Gaussian mixture density to model the background signal distribution and combine this with a uniform distribution for modelling vascular signal to give a Maxwell–Gaussian-uniform (MGU) mixture model of image intensity. The MGU model parameters are estimated by the modified expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. In addition, it is shown that the Maxwell–Gaussian mixture distribution (a) models the background signal more accurately than a Maxwell distribution, (b) exhibits a better fit to clinical data and (c) gives fewer false positive voxels (misclassified vessel voxels) in segmentation. The new segmentation algorithm is tested on an aneurysm phantom data set and two clinical data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide a better quality of segmentation when both speed and phase information are utilised.}

Studying operators' perception of robot operational characteristics such as safe robot idle time can help develop hazard prevention strategies, and ultimately improve robot safety. Results of data collected from 32 participants showed that robot size and speed had significant effects on the perception of safe robot idle time. This study also examined operators' perceived acceptability level for the robot speed, perceived level of hazard of robot motion, perceived chance of error, and self-reported mental workload. Results of this study were compared to the findings of Rahimi, M., Karwowski, W. [1990. Human perception of robot safe speed and idle time. Behaviour & Information Technology 9(5), 381–389], in which their experiment was conducted in a real industrial environment. This study demonstrated the feasibility of testing human perception of dynamic moving objects in a virtual reality environment. The virtual reality technology is believed to be capable of modeling a complex machinery system such as a robotic system. Relevance to industry: Human perception of the operational characteristics of industrial robots is an important concern for robot safety since misperception can cause robot operators to err, which in turn can cause injuries and fatalities. Through this study we (1) understand human perception, safety behavior, and decision making in a robotic system and (2) demonstrate the capability of modeling a complex machinery system using virtual reality technology. Our experiments designed to study human perception of safe robot idle time could lead to safety interventions and guidelines or hazard prevention strategy development.}

The formed LAP/Fe3O4-PLA-PEG-G2-FA NPs can display good colloidal stability and an enhanced r2 relaxivity of 327.6 mM−1 s−1. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the hybrid nanoparticles are cytocompatible in the studied concentration range, and could specific target cancer cells with FA receptors overexpression. Finally, the xenografted tumor model experiment verifies that LAP/Fe3O4-PLA-PEG-G2-FA NPs can significantly reduce the MR signal of tumor site by specific accumulation, and be metabolized from the mice within 24 h. Therefore, LAP/Fe3O4-PLA-PEG-G2-FA NPs with good biocompatibility, a high r2 relaxivity, and FA targetability show a huge potential as a targeted T2-weighted MR imaging contrast for the early diagnosis of tumors overexpressing FA receptors.}

However, the effect of CO gas on fluid flow and decarburization is not reported in the existing literatures. Based on the Eulerian-Eulerian approach, a two-way coupling mathematical model considering CO gas is proposed to investigate the coupling phenomenon of Ar-CO-liquid steel flow and decarburization in SSRF. And the industrial experimental data is employed to validate the numerical result. In comparison with the one-way coupling model, the numerical result predicted by the two-way coupling model is closer to the industrial experimental data. The CO mole number, which is generated by the overall decarburization process, is about 3 times the argon mole number blown into the ladle, and the CO generation rate is greater than argon blowing rate at the first 12 min. Because of the stirring effect of CO gas, there are the more complex fluid flow, the stronger mass transfer, the greater decarburization rate and the lower carbon mass concentration in the liquid steel during decarburization. Besides, the Ar plume area predicted by the two-way coupling model is larger and it is closer to the center line of the snorkel. Therefore, the effect of CO gas on the fluid flow cannot be ignored and the two-way coupling model can describe the metallurgical phenomena in SSRF more precisely.}

However, energy performance gap is a significant barrier to the development of low or zero carbon buildings. A predominant reason of the performance gap is the insufficient consideration of residents’ needs, which may lead to subsequent inappropriate user behaviours. Previous research on energy-related occupant behaviour is built either on statistical analysis from post-occupancy evaluations or stochastic models. There is a lack of pre-occupancy measurement of the interaction between occupant behaviour and building design alternatives. This paper aims to develop an innovative analytic approach using virtual reality (VR) technology to help building designers (architects, system engineers and interior designers) to identify the design pattern which guides the occupants to behave in the most energy-efficient way, so as to closing the energy performance gap resulting from occupants’ misconduct. The paper presents a VR-assisted innovative occupant-engaged framework in building energy design based on Design with Intent (DwI) method. Then the approach is validated by a case study on lighting control design for a sample residential building project in Hong Kong. The combination with decision-making is recommended for further research.}

abstract = {MRI is an inherently slow process, which leads to long scan time for high-resolution imaging. The speed of acquisition can be increased by ignoring parts of the data (undersampling). Consequently, this leads to the degradation of image quality, such as loss of resolution or introduction of image artefacts. This work aims to reconstruct highly undersampled Cartesian or radial MR acquisitions, with better resolution and with less to no artefact compared to conventional techniques like compressed sensing. In recent times, deep learning has emerged as a very important area of research and has shown immense potential in solving inverse problems, e.g. MR image reconstruction. In this paper, a deep learning based MR image reconstruction framework is proposed, which includes a modified regularised version of ResNet as the network backbone to remove artefacts from the undersampled image, followed by data consistency steps that fusions the network output with the data already available from undersampled k-space in order to further improve reconstruction quality. The performance of this framework for various undersampling patterns has also been tested, and it has been observed that the framework is robust to deal with various sampling patterns, even when mixed together while training, and results in very high quality reconstruction, in terms of high SSIM (highest being 0.990 ± 0.006 for acceleration factor of 3.5), while being compared with the fully sampled reconstruction. It has been shown that the proposed framework can successfully reconstruct even for an acceleration factor of 20 for Cartesian (0.968 ± 0.005) and 17 for radially (0.962 ± 0.012) sampled data. Furthermore, it has been shown that the framework preserves brain pathology during reconstruction while being trained on healthy subjects.}

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a new paradigm for time delayed teleoperation - exocentric navigation and publishes experimental results of this paradigm in comparison with the more commonly used navigation algorithm which will be termed egocentric navigation. A typical example for egocentric navigation is steering of a car, where navigation is a continuous process with orientation and displacement occurring simultaneously. Exocentric navigation approaches the navigation problem as a two step process, orientation followed by displacement. It can be viewed as partial autonomy in navigation, where orientation is autonomously performed by the remote robot without assistance and displacement is determined by the human operator using, in most instances, a joystick that controls both direction and speed. Evaluation of the exocentric paradigm consists of testing it with respect to navigation, perception and manipulation. System performance is measured in terms of navigation times and number of collisions and operator performance is measured using Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The new paradigm is tested on users both with and without prior experience with results aimed at aiding human operator training.}

This paper shows how virtual reality (VR) simulation [1] can be used as a tool to analyze the maintenance process, to predict the mean time to repair and to ensure the RH compatibility of one ITER sub-system, the Upper Port Launcher (UPL) [2]. Special emphasis is put on the development of RH procedures and the identification of tooling requirements. The possibility to simulate RH logistics and repair actions in an early stage of the design process allows for the identification of those maintenance actions that require dedicated tests in the Launcher Handling Test Facility at Karlsruhe. The VR analysis, together with dedicated mock-up tests will demonstrate the RH compatibility of the UPL plug, provide input to the design of the Port Plug maintenance area in the ITER Hot Cell, and support the development of RH maintenance tooling.}

We paid attention to make the analysis of the same spot of the sample. It is shown, that the bombardment of graphene on Cu substrate leads to edge etching and decrease of graphene crystallites size. The samples on Si/SiO2 appear less susceptible to etching, however, the defect concentrations reach up the value two orders of magnitude higher than that in graphene on Cu. It is explained by an interaction of carbon on the defect sites introduced under the bombardment with carbon-oxygen radicals generated due to decomposition of organic groups adsorbed on graphene surface.}

abstract = {Background Within a virtual environment (VE) the control of locomotion (e.g., self-travel) is critical for creating a realistic and functional experience. Usually the direction of locomotion, while using a head-mounted display (HMD), is determined by the direction the head is pointing and the forward or backward motion is controlled with a hand held controllers. However, hand held devices can be difficult to use while the eyes are covered with a HMD. Free hand gestures, that are tracked with a camera or a hand data glove, have an advantage of eliminating the need to look at the hand controller but the design of hand or finger gestures for this purpose has not been well developed. Methods This study used a depth-sensing camera to track fingertip location (curling and straightening the fingers), which was converted to forward or backward self-travel in the VE. Fingertip position was converted to self-travel velocity using a mapping function with three parameters: a region of zero velocity (dead zone) around the relaxed hand position, a linear relationship of fingertip position to velocity (slope or/J) beginning at the edge of the dead zone, and an exponential relationship rather than a linear one mapping fingertip position to velocity (exponent). Using a HMD, participants moved forward along a virtual road and stopped at a target on the road by controlling self-travel velocity with finger flexion and extension. Each of the 3 mapping function parameters was tested at 3 levels. Outcomes measured included usability ratings, fatigue, nausea, and time to complete the tasks. Results Twenty subjects participated but five did not complete the study due to nausea. The size of the dead zone had little effect on performance or usability. Subjects preferred lower β values which were associated with better subjective ratings of control and reduced time to complete the task, especially for large targets. Exponent values of 1.0 or greater were preferred and reduced the time to complete the task, especially for small targets. Conclusions Small finger movements can be used to control velocity of self-travel in VE. The functions used for converting fingertip position to movement velocity influence usability and performance.}

abstract = {At early ages (less than 24 h), cracking can occur in concrete because it can be subjected to dimensional changes, due to shrinkage, can generate loads which are greater than the low strength capacity of the material at this age. This is especially the case in members with highly exposed surfaces, such as floor slabs or precast panels. As any other cement based composite, Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) shrinks at an early age and can crack when shrinkage is restrained. One possible solution to reduce the impact of early age shrinkage on concrete durability is to include low volumetric fractions of short fibers in order to control crack growth. To evaluate the cracking control ability of Alkali Resistant (AR) glass fibers in standard concrete and SCC, an experimental program, developed in accordance with the AR-glass fiber producer, was conducted. Two different types of AR-glass dispersible fibers, two concrete compositions and several volumetric fractions of fiber have been studied. The experimental program included a mechanical characterization of the different concrete compositions (compression and flexural strength tests), free shrinkage tests, with and without air flow over the samples, and double restrained slab cracking tests (Kraai slab modified test). The results obtained show that the inclusion of low volumetric fractions of the two types of AR-glass fiber under study can control the cracking produced due to very early age shrinkage on both standard concrete and SCC in two different ways: reducing the total cracked area and the maximum length of the cracks. Although, a non-linear dependence of cracked area on AR-glass fiber amount was found. A microscopic study of the cracked surface confirms the favorable effect of the presence of dispersed AR-glass fibers on cracking control. When standard concrete and SCC results were compared, it was observed that, although SCC drying shrinkage was larger, standard concrete with a similar performance in the hardened state produced equivalent cracking area.}

The difference between traditional assumptions and VR test results of occupant evacuation is compared. The study shows that most of the subjects tested, as occupants, choose different exits from the ones pre-assumed in the space zoning stage. A significant difference exists between the result derived from traditional calculation method and VR simulation. The function used to calculate evacuation time seems to be effective only when egress signs work properly. Very few subjects choose the shortest egress route as expected, although zoning-based calculation may conclude that a building is secure based on tolerable evacuation time. The route indicated by evacuation signs is not necessarily the shortest one. A case associated with four scenarios is simulated and tested. The result reflects the importance of layout in the planning strategy applied in zoning and egress routes due to building fire.}

CTU has decided to build the new nuclear facility (VR-2 SCA) even though it already operates one (VR-1 Training reactor). The main motivation is a worldwide large demand for education and training at nuclear research facilities. Currently, VR-1 Training reactor is reaching its maximum capacity, especially during a semester when the utilization reaches almost 100%. It is expected VR-2 SCA provides additional capacity for training and education in a field of nuclear engineering and enhances research possibilities at CTU. Interesting areas of research that could be addressed at the VR-2 reactor are: benchmark experiments, criticality safety studies, studies of accelerator driven systems and development/testing of radiation detection systems. VR-2 SCA is designed as an open pool vessel including a water-moderated uranium core. The core will consist of a combination of an enriched and natural uranium fuel. The SCA will be driven by a D-D neutron generator. The generator can operate in both continuous and pulse mode, and thus allowing pulse neutron source experiments. The facility keeps a high level of flexibility where many parameters can be changed, e.g. geometry of a core lattice, moderator temperature, water level etc.}

In the current paper, we propose a fast and accurate automatic method for lung segmentation and volumetry. Our approach follows a “coarse-to-fine” segmentation strategy. First, we extract the lungs and trachea excluding the main pulmonary vessels. This step is executed very fast and allows for measuring the volume of both structures. Thereafter, we start a refinement procedure that consists of three main stages: trachea extraction, lung separation, and filling the cavities on the final lung masks. After the trachea extraction step the volumes of both lungs without the main vessels can be measured. The final segmentation step results in the volumes of the left and right lungs including the vessels. The method has been tested by processing MR datasets from ten healthy participants. We compare our results with manually produced masks and obtain high agreement between the expert reading and our method: the True Positive Volume Fraction is more than 95%. The proposed automatic approach is fast and accurate enough to be applied in clinical routine for processing of thousands of participants.}

A general analytic formula for gas-mixture conduction covering the whole range of rarefaction has been derived based on fundamental equations. The major factors affecting the heat transfer process within a gas gap have been discussed. A gas gap with control strategy has been designed for heat transfer limit measurement of a high temperature heat pipe. The results show that the influence of the non-linear temperature effect of thermal conductivity is weak on the heat flux. The gas conduction is primary or even dominant within gas gaps in comparison with the thermal radiation. The sensitivity of the heat flux’s dependence on the pressure can be characterized by a pressure coefficient Kp, which is a function of the composition, the temperature and the gap thickness. The possible working states of the heat pipe are found to be divided into two regions by the heat flux curve of normal-pressure Ar gap, and the tuning strategy of the heat flux based on the pressure and the composition are different in different regions.}

Many studies have investigated the effects of VAC using 3D displays and expensive complex apparatus and setup to create natural and conflicting viewing conditions.

Our main objective, in this work, is to test how the modern VR headsets (VR simulated depth) could affect our vergence system, in addition to investigating the effect of the simulated depth on the eye-gaze performance. The virtual scenario used included a common virtual object (a cube) in a simple virtual environment with no constraints placed on the head and neck movement of the subjects. We used ocular biomechanics and eye tracking to compare between vergence angles in matching (ideal) and conflicting (real) viewing conditions. Real vergence angle during immersion was significantly higher than ideal vergence angle and exhibited higher variability which leads to incorrect depth cues that affects depth perception and also leads to visual fatigue for prolonged virtual experiences. Additionally, we found that as the simulated depth increases, the ability of users to manipulate virtual objects with their eyes decreases, thus, decreasing the possibilities of interaction through eye gaze. The biomechanics model used here can be further extended to study muscular activity of eye muscles during immersion. It presents an efficient and flexible assessment tool for virtual environments.}

Compressed sensing (CS) is often used to accelerate magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. A novelty deeply unfolded networks (DUNs) based method, designed by unfolding a traditional CS-MRI optimization algorithm into deep networks, can provide significantly faster reconstruction speeds than traditional CS-MRI methods while improving image quality.
Methods
In this paper, we propose a High-Throughput Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Network (HFIST-Net) for reconstructing MR images from sparse measurements by combining traditional model-based CS techniques and data-driven deep learning methods. Specifically, the conventional Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) method is expanded as a deep network. To break the bottleneck of information transmission, a multi-channel fusion mechanism is proposed to improve the efficiency of information transmission between adjacent network stages. Moreover, a simple yet efficient channel attention block, called Gaussian context transformer (GCT), is proposed to improve the characterization capabilities of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN,) which utilizes Gaussian functions that satisfy preset relationships to achieve context feature excitation.
Results
T1 and T2 brain MR images from the FastMRI dataset are used to validate the performance of the proposed HFIST-Net. The qualitative and quantitative results showed that our method is superior to those compared state-of-the-art unfolded deep learning networks.
Conclusions
The proposed HFIST-Net is capable of reconstructing more accurate MR image details from highly undersampled k-space data while maintaining fast computational speed.}

The MR damping system with lumped mass proposed in this study it was constituted by three components: a MR damper (30kN) which connected two spans of a bridge and two spans themselves made different mass and stiffness. Its function was designed to impose an effective check on relative displacement and pounding. In order to prove its effectiveness, a two-span bridge (8.3m long) was constructed with a MR damper installed beneath the two spans. First, a mathematical model of the bridge was derived; also, a model of the MR damper was verified through a separate test on its performance. Next, shaking table tests were carried out by inflicting 150% of El-centro earthquake and 60% of Kobe earthquake to see how effective the system would be in mitigating seismic responses. All the tests were done under various conditions (un-control, passive off, passive on, Lyapunov control, and Clipped-optional control) in order to closely examine and analyze under which condition mitigation could be maximized and how mitigation could be effected. As a result of the tests, it was found that the MR damping system with lumped mass was effective in preventing two spans from pounding each other and its active performance decreased the relative displacement of the bridge structure. Therefore, it was proven to be effective in attenuating the seismic responses of two-span bridge in longitudinal direction.}

abstract = {Orthopedic drilling as a skill demands high levels of dexterity and expertise from the surgeon. It is a basic skill that is required in many orthopedic procedures. Inefficient drilling can be a source of avoidable medical errors that may lead to adverse events. It is hence important to train and evaluate residents in safe environments for this skill. This paper presents a virtual orthopedic drilling simulator that was designed to provide visiohaptic interaction with virtual bones. The simulation provides a realistic basic training environment for orthopedic surgeons. It contains modules to track and analyze movements of surgeons, in order to determine their surgical proficiency. The simulator was tested with senior surgeons, residents and medical students for validation purposes. Through the multi-tiered testing strategy it was shown that the simulator was able to produce a learning effect that transfers to real-world drilling. Further, objective measures of surgical performance were found to be able to differentiate between experts and novices.}

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being used increasingly for image-guided targeted biopsy and focal therapy of prostate cancer. In this paper, a combined rigid and deformable registration technique is proposed to register pre-treatment diagnostic 3T magnetic resonance (MR) images of the prostate, with the identified target tumor(s), to intra-treatment 1.5T MR images. The pre-treatment T2-weighted MR images were acquired with patients in a supine position using an endorectal coil in a 3T scanner, while the intra-treatment T2-weighted MR images were acquired in a 1.5T scanner before insertion of the needle with patients in the semi-lithotomy position. Both the rigid and deformable registration algorithms employ an intensity-based distance metric defined based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptors (MIND) between images. The optimization routine for estimating the rigid transformation parameters is initialized using four pairs of manually selected approximate corresponding points on the boundaries of the prostate. In this paper, the problem of deformable image registration is approached from the perspective of state estimation for dynamical systems. The registration algorithm employs a rather generic dynamic linear elastic model of the tissue deformation discretized by the finite element method (FEM). We use the model in a classical state estimation framework to estimate the deformation of the prostate based on the distance metric between pre- and intra-treatment images. Our deformable registration results using 17 sets of prostate MR images showed that the proposed method yielded a target registration error (TRE) of 1.87±0.94mm,2.03±0.94mm, and 1.70±0.93mm for the whole gland (WG), central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively, using 76 manually-identified fiducial points. This was an improvement over the 2.67±1.31mm, 2.95±1.43mm, and 2.34±1.11mm, respectively for the WG, CG, and PZ after rigid registration alone. Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) in the WG, CG and PZ were 88.2±5.3, 85.6±7.6 and 68.7±6.9 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the mean absolute distances (MAD) between surfaces was 1.26±0.56mm and 1.27±0.55mm in the WG and CG, after deformable registration. These results indicate that the proposed registration technique has sufficient accuracy for localizing prostate tumors in MRI-guided targeted biopsy or focal therapy of clinically localized prostate cancer.}

The objective of this paper was to determine if the use of PO had any impact over the low temperature performance of laboratory mixes produced with AR binders that were also laboratory produced. The low temperature performance of the laboratory produced asphalt rubber (AR) mixes were evaluated by means of the semicircular bend geometry test, utilizing two types of ground tire rubber (ambient and cryogenic) at two different percentages of polyoctenamer (PO). Stiffness, fracture toughness and fracture energy for the mixes were obtained in order to statistically evaluate how the variables influence their low temperature performance. Overall, the laboratory test results indicate that the use of PO at the dosage utilized and the rubber types at the percentage employed will not adversely impact the low temperature performance of AR mixes; furthermore the use of PO can increase the fracture toughness of AR mixes, making the pavements less brittle at lower temperatures.}

A frequency estimator for the road based on the deflection of the suspension is the key component of the fault detection system. In order to improve the efficiency of the detection system an observable domain switch was introduced. This switch identifies the most sensible transmissibility domain in order to improve the efficiency of the proposal. Intensive randomly generated tests with less than 36 % average in detection error using a semi-active MR damper validates the transmissibility as a good indicator of MR damper condition.}

Variability in contrast, appearance, orientation, and placement of the heart between patients, clinical views, scanners, and protocols makes fully automatic semantic segmentation a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we present Ω-Net (Omega-Net): A novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for simultaneous localization, transformation into a canonical orientation, and semantic segmentation. First, an initial segmentation is performed on the input image; second, the features learned during this initial segmentation are used to predict the parameters needed to transform the input image into a canonical orientation; and third, a final segmentation is performed on the transformed image. In this work, Ω-Nets of varying depths were trained to detect five foreground classes in any of three clinical views (short axis, SA; four-chamber, 4C; two-chamber, 2C), without prior knowledge of the view being segmented. This constitutes a substantially more challenging problem compared with prior work. The architecture was trained using three-fold cross-validation on a cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, N=42) and healthy control subjects (N=21). Network performance, as measured by weighted foreground intersection-over-union (IoU), was substantially improved for the best-performing Ω-Net compared with U-Net segmentation without localization or orientation (0.858 vs 0.834). In addition, to be comparable with other works, Ω-Net was retrained from scratch using five-fold cross-validation on the publicly available 2017 MICCAI Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset. The Ω-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method in segmentation of the LV and RV bloodpools, and performed slightly worse in segmentation of the LV myocardium. We conclude that this architecture represents a substantive advancement over prior approaches, with implications for biomedical image segmentation more generally.}

A cantilevered sandwich plate consisting of an aluminum host layer with nine equal cavities for the MR fluid treatments and a constraining layer was fabricated for experimental characterizations and validations of the finite-element (FE) model. The dynamic responses of the untreated plate and the partially treated plate, where only one of the nine cavities in the core layer was filled with the MR fluid (MRF 132DG), were measured under harmonic excitation applied at the fixed support. The finite element model of the sandwich plate, developed using the classical plate theory (CPT) and first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is verified using the experimental data. The FE model considers the effect of slippage between the top and bottom layers of the structure. The validated FE model is subsequently used to investigate the effects of partial MR fluid treatments, magnetic flux intensity and boundary conditions on the dynamic response characteristics of the structure. The effect of shear deformation on the vibration properties of the MR sandwich plate is further highlighted. Finally, three optimization problems are formulated to identify optimal locations for the MR fluid treatments so as to maximize the variations in the natural frequencies and damping ratios in response to magnetic field. The solution of the optimization problem, attained using the genetic algorithm (GA) suggested that the MR fluid applied to locations with noticeable shear strain can maximize the stiffness variations and damping of the structure, significantly.}

A chemical kinetic model (OXYMECH 2.0) for pressurized oxy-fuel combustion was developed by updating several key elementary reactions in our previous model (OXYMECH 1.0). OXYMECH 2.0 was validated based on experimentally measured IDTs for methane, ethane, and propane in O2/CO2, O2/N2, and O2/Ar atmospheres in a pressure range of 1–250 atm, as well as laminar flame speeds (LFSs) in pressure and temperature ranges of 1–4 atm and 298–543 K, respectively. The OXYMECH 1.0, Aramco 3.0, CRECK, and DTU models were also evaluated; the results indicate that OXYMECH 2.0 performs better than other models in terms of predicting the IDTs and LFSs of C1–C3 alkanes in O2/CO2 and O2/N2 atmospheres. A detailed comparison between the OXYMECH 2.0 and Aramco 3.0 models was also performed. The influences of the pressure, equivalence ratio, and CO2 concentration on the IDTs of propane were analyzed in detail.}

abstract = {Background
Tears of the acetabular labrum are frequently present in patients with groin pain. While it is clear that the labrum contributes to the surface area articulating with the femoral head, it is not clear whether labral repair yields different load distribution in the hip compared to labral resection.
Purpose
Determine whether labral repair reduces cartilage strain more effectively than labral resection.
Methods
Six human cadaveric hips (mean age 37 years) were loaded in a simulated single-leg stance within the bore of a 7T MR scanner. After cartilage had reached a steady-state thickness distribution, a scan of the cartilage was acquired with a voxel size of 0.1×0.1×0.3mm. This method was repeated for each of six specimens when the labrum was intact, after a surgically simulated labral tear, after an arthroscopic labral repair and after labral resection. Cartilage thickness and strain in an anterosuperior region of interest were measured from the MR scans. A paired t-test was used to compare mean and maximum cartilage strain when the labrum was intact vs. torn, torn vs. repaired and repaired vs. resected. Three-dimensional patterns of cartilage strain distribution were qualitatively compared for the different labral conditions.
Results
For the number of specimens tested we found no change in mean and maximum cartilage strain, and little obvious change in the pattern of cartilage strain distribution after a simulated labral tear. Labral repair caused a 2% decrease in mean cartilage strain compared to a torn labrum (p=0.014). Labral resection caused a 4% and 6% increase in mean and maximum cartilage strain, respectively, compared to labral repair (p=0.02), and the cartilage strain distribution was elevated throughout the region of interest.
Conclusion
Based on our ex vivo findings of increased cartilage strain after labral resection when compared to labral repair, we have demonstrated the associated consequences to the mechanical environment of the cartilage following surgical treatment of the labrum.}

The tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor was significantly hyperintense relative to that of cerebral abscess wall on both diffusion-weighted images and regional cerebral blood volume maps. Sixteen patients who had cerebral masses with large cystic or necrotic cavities were imaged to generate diffusion-weighted images and regional cerebral blood volume maps using single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI) pulse sequences. Apart from qualitative analysis, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) as well as regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratios were calculated from the abscess wall and peripheral tumor wall and comparison was made by using Student's t-test. The tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor had significantly lower ADCs relative to those of the abscess wall (P<0.005) and thus appeared relatively hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images. The mean rCBV ratio relative to normal white matter (2.90±0.62) of the peripheral tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor were significantly larger than the mean rCBV ratio (0.45±0.11) of the pyogenic cerebral abscess wall (P<0.001) by Student's t-test.

In this paper, we propose JET: Joint source and channel coding for Error resilient virtual reality video wireless Transmission, where we jointly investigate how to conquer the problem of source video’s huge size, how to efficiently satisfy a user’s view switch request and how to handle packet loss. Specifically, we first divide a VR video into smaller video tiles. Upon a user’s view switch request, the tiles corresponding to the part that the user is requesting, referred to as the field of view (FoV), and the part that the user may switch to before new video can be received, are delivered over a wireless network. We consider unequal error protection (UEP) for FoV and the rest part and formulate the inherent error resilient VR video transmission problem into a joint source and channel coding problem. In particular, we optimize the tile partition, quantization parameter and Forward Error Correction (FEC) packet allocation to maximize a user’s received video quality. We also propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Extensive simulations are conducted and simulation results verify the superior performance.}

In this paper, an efficient fully-automatic brain tissue segmentation algorithm based on a clustering fusion technique is presented. In the training phase of this algorithm, the pixel intensity value is scaled to enhance the contrast of the image. The brain image pixels that have similar intensity are then grouped into objects using a superpixel algorithm. Further, three clustering techniques are utilized to segment each object. For each clustering technique, a neural network (NN) model is fed with features extracted from the image objects and is trained using the labels produced by that clustering technique. In the testing phase, pre-processing step includes scaling and resizing the brain image are applied then the superpixel algorithm partitions the image into multiple objects (similar to the training phase). The three trained neural network models are then used to predict the respective class of each object and the obtained classes are combined using majority voting. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on various MR brain images and compared with the three base clustering techniques.}

abstract = {Despite the increasing amount of attention paid to virtual reality (VR) tourism and the rising importance of VR tourism, a theoretically integrated model of behavior has not been developed. To fill this void, we build and test a framework based on both innovation diffusion and uses and gratifications theories to explain why people participate in VR tourism. The moderating role of VR tourists’ technology readiness (optimism and innovativeness) between subjective well-being and behavioral intention is also examined. Results demonstrate that authentic experience and subjective well-being are affected by simplicity, benefit, compatibility (attributes of innovation diffusion), informativeness, social interactivity, and playfulness (uses and gratifications attributes). Behavioral intention is more positively influenced by subjective well-being than by authentic experience. The moderating role of technology readiness between subjective well-being and behavioral intention is stronger in individuals with high optimism and innovativeness than their counterparts with low optimism and innovativeness.}

abstract = {Central Venous Catheterization (CVC) is conducted in more than 5 million patients annually in the United States. Currently, CVC theoretical knowledge is typically taught with didactic lectures with minimal assessment of knowledge before simulation training and clinical environment. To assess CVC theoretical knowledge, virtual reality (VR) can develop residents’ surgical skills and can provide feedback on performance. While all types of VR can be used to assess improvements in residents’ knowledge prior to simulation training, few studies have compared the impact of non-immersive VR on improving resident knowledge. The current study was developed to identify the utility of a non-immersive CathSim VR on improvements in resident CVC theoretical knowledge, self-efficacy, and satisfaction when compared to a traditional multiple-choice assessment This was completed through an empirical investigation with 34 medical residents. The results showed that when compared to a traditional multiple-choice assessment, the non-immersive CathSim VR assessment led to improvements in self-efficacy and potentially better learning experience. Meanwhile, results also showed that there were no differences in assessment score, number of attempts, and overall satisfaction. Thus, we can conclude that non-immersive VR has the potential to be more effective than traditional multiple-choice test in improving self-efficacy and is as effective for residents’ assessment score, number of attempts, and overall satisfaction.}
