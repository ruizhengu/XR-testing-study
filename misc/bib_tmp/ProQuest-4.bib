abstract={In multicenter MRI studies, pooling the imaging data can introduce site-related variabilities and can therefore bias the subsequent analyses. To harmonize the intensity distributions of brain MR images in a multicenter dataset, unsupervised deep learning methods can be employed. Here, we developed a model based on cycle-consistent adversarial networks for the harmonization of T1-weighted brain MR images. In contrast to previous works, it was designed to process three-dimensional whole-brain images in a stable manner while optimizing computation resources. Using six different MRI datasets for healthy adults (n=1525 in total) with different acquisition parameters, we tested the model in (i) three pairwise harmonizations with site effects of various sizes, (ii) an overall harmonization of the six datasets with different age distributions, and (iii) a traveling-subject dataset. Our results for intensity distributions, brain volumes, image quality metrics and radiomic features indicated that the MRI characteristics at the various sites had been effectively homogenized. Next, brain age prediction experiments and the observed correlation between the gray-matter volume and age showed that thanks to an appropriate training strategy and despite biological differences between the dataset populations, the model reinforced biological patterns. Furthermore, radiologic analyses of the harmonized images attested to the conservation of the radiologic information in the original images. The robustness of the harmonization model (as judged with various datasets and metrics) demonstrates its potential for application in retrospective multicenter studies.},

abstract={BackgroundNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. To avoid limitations of liver biopsy and MRI, quantitative ultrasound has become a research focus. Ultrasound-derived fat fraction (UDFF) is based on a combination of backscatter coefficient and attenuation parameter.ObjectiveThe objectives of the study were to determine (1) agreement between UDFF/MRI proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF) and (2) whether BMI and age are predictive for UDFF.Materials and methodsThis cross-sectional prospective study included a convenience sample of 46 children referred for clinically indicated abdominal MRI. MR-PDFF and five acquisitions of UDFF were collected. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to assess agreement between MR-PDFF and UDFF. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for UDFF prediction of liver steatosis (MR-PDFF ≥ 6%). Multivariable regression was performed to assess BMI and age as predictors for UDFF.ResultsTwenty-two participants were male, 24 were female, and the mean age was 14 ± 3 (range: 7-18) years. Thirty-six out of 46 participants had normal liver fat fraction <6%, and 10/46 had liver steatosis. UDFF was positively associated with MR-PDFF (ICC 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96). The mean bias between UDFF and MR-PDFF was 0.64% (95% LOA, -5.3-6.6%). AUROC of UDFF for steatosis was of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-0.99). UDFF cutoff of 6% had a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI, 55-99%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI, 81-0.99%). BMI was an independent predictor of UDFF (correlation: 0.55 (95% CI, 0.35-0.95)).ConclusionsUDFF shows strong agreement with MR-PDFF in children. A UDFF cutoff of 6% provides good sensitivity and specificity for detection of MR-PDFF of ≥ 6%.},

abstract={Radiotherapy treatment planning based only on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become clinically achievable. Though computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for radiotherapy imaging, directly providing the electron density values needed for planning calculations, MRI has superior soft tissue visualisation to guide treatment planning decisions and optimisation. MRI-only planning removes the need for the CT scan, but requires generation of a substitute/synthetic/pseudo CT (sCT) for electron density information. Shortening the MRI imaging time would improve patient comfort and reduce the likelihood of motion artefacts. A volunteer study was previously carried out to investigate and optimise faster MRI sequences for a hybrid atlas-voxel conversion to sCT for prostate treatment planning. The aim of this follow-on study was to clinically validate the performance of the new optimised sequence for sCT generation in a treated MRI-only prostate patient cohort. 10 patients undergoing MRI-only treatment were scanned on a Siemens Skyra 3T MRI as part of the MRI-only sub-study of the NINJA clinical trial (ACTRN12618001806257). Two sequences were used, the standard 3D T2-weighted SPACE sequence used for sCT conversion which has been previously validated against CT, and a modified fast SPACE sequence, selected based on the volunteer study. Both were used to generate sCT scans. These were then compared to evaluate the fast sequence conversion for anatomical and dosimetric accuracy against the clinically approved treatment plans. The average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the body was 14.98 ± 2.35 HU, and for bone was 40.77 ± 5.51 HU. The external volume contour comparison produced a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of at least 0.976, and an average of 0.985 ± 0.004, and the bony anatomy contour comparison a DSC of at least 0.907, and an average of 0.950 ± 0.018. The fast SPACE sCT agreed with the gold standard sCT within an isocentre dose of -0.28% ± 0.16% and an average gamma pass rate of 99.66% ± 0.41% for a 1%/1 mm gamma tolerance. In this clinical validation study, the fast sequence, which reduced the required imaging time by approximately a factor of 4, produced an sCT with similar clinical dosimetric results compared to the standard sCT, demonstrating its potential for clinical use for treatment planning.},

abstract={There are limited experimental data on VHCF for structural steels for >107 cycles. Unalloyed low-carbon steel S275JR+AR is a common structural material for the heavy machinery in minerals, sand and aggregate applications. The purpose of this research is to investigate the fatigue behaviour in the gigacycle domain (>109 cycles) for S275JR+AR grade steel. This is achieved using accelerated ultrasonic fatigue testing in as-manufactured, pre-corroded and non-zero mean stress conditions. As internal heat generation is a massive challenge for ultrasonic fatigue testing of structural steels which exhibit a pronounced frequency effect, effective temperature control is crucial for implementation of testing. The frequency effect is assessed by comparing the test data at 20 kHz and 15-20 Hz. Its contribution is significant, as there is no overlap between the stress ranges of interest. The obtained data are intended to be applied to the fatigue assessments of the equipment operating at the frequency for up to 1010 cycles over years of continuous service.},

abstract={ObjectiveTo investigate the accuracy and reliability of augmented reality (AR) technique in locating the perforating vessels of the posterior tibial artery during the repair of soft tissue defects of the lower limbs with the posterior tibial artery perforator flap.MethodsBetween June 2019 and June 2022, the posterior tibial artery perforator flap was used to repair the skin and soft tissue defects around the ankle in 10 cases. There were 7 males and 3 females with an average age of 53.7 years (mean, 33-69 years). The injury was caused by traffic accident in 5 cases, bruising by heavy weight in 4 cases, and machine injury in 1 case. The size of wound ranged from 5 cm×3 cm to 14 cm×7 cm. The interval between injury and operation was 7-24 days (mean, 12.8 days). The CT angiography of lower limbs before operation was performed and the data was used to reconstruct the three-dimensional images of perforating vessels and bones with Mimics software. The above images were projected and superimposed on the surface of the affected limb using AR technology, and the skin flap was designed and resected with precise positioning. The size of the flap ranged from 6 cm×4 cm to 15 cm×8 cm. The donor site was sutured directly or repaired with skin graft.ResultsThe 1-4 perforator branches of posterior tibial artery (mean, 3.4 perforator branches) in 10 patients were located by AR technique before operation. The location of perforator vessels during operation was basically consistent with that of AR before operation. The distance between the two locations ranged from 0 to 16 mm, with an average of 12.2 mm. The flap was successfully harvested and repaired according to the preoperative design. Nine flaps survived without vascular crisis. The local infection of skin graft occurred in 2 cases and the necrosis of the distal edge of the flap in 1 case, which healed after dressing change. The other skin grafts survived, and the incisions healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 6-12 months, with an average of 10.3 months. The flap was soft without obvious scar hyperplasia and contracture. At last follow-up, according to the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Association (AOFAS) score, the ankle function was excellent in 8 cases, good in 1 case, and poor in 1 case.ConclusionAR technique can be used to determine the location of perforator vessels in the preoperative planning of the posterior tibial artery perforator flap, which can reduce the risk of flap necrosis, and the operation is simple.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDTo date, the vast majority of research on disordered eating symptomatology and body image disturbances from the Arab world have been performed exclusively among women; and mainly used thinness-oriented measures that are not sensitive to detect muscularity-oriented symptoms, which are more evident in males. Therefore, the objective of our study was to validate the Arabic version of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (Ar-MDDI), in order to make it accessible for Arabic-speaking populations.METHODSUsing a snowball sampling technique, men university students (n = 396) from multiple universities in Lebanon filled the survey in this cross-sectional designed study (January-May 2022). A soft copy of the questionnaire was created using google forms software, and sent to participants through the different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We used the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory to assess Muscle Dysmorphia, along with the Big Three Perfectionism Scale to assess perfectionism and Eating Attitude Test (EAT) to evaluate the inappropriate eating attitudes. To explore the factor structure of Ar-MDDI, we computed a principal-axis Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with the first split-half subsample using the FACTOR software. We used data from the second split-half to conduct a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using the SPSS AMOS v.29 software. Pearson correlation test was used to test the convergent and divergent validity of the Ar-MDDI scale with the other scores included in the study.RESULTSThe results of the EFA revealed three factors, which explained 57.68% of the common variance: Factor 1 = Appearance intolerance, Factor 2 = Drive for size, and Factor 3 = Functional impairment. The CFA fit indices of the three-factor model of the Ar-MDDI scale showed good results. Moreover, 254 (64.1%) of the participants had inappropriate eating attitudes (EAT scores ≥ 20). Indices suggested that configural, metric, and scalar invariance was supported according to eating attitudes. No significant difference between participants with appropriate versus inappropriate eating attitudes in terms of functional impairment, drive for size and appearance intolerance. Perfectionism scores correlated positively with the Ar-MDDI, which suggests divergent validity.CONCLUSIONOur findings revealed that the validation of the Arabic scale yielded excellent properties, preliminarily supporting its use for the assessment of muscle dysmorphia among Arabic-speaking university men. This would hopefully allow for its timely detection and management in Arab clinical settings and encourage cross-cultural research on this topic.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of augmented reality (AR) using a 3D app in a smartphone on students' learning outcomes and satisfaction in teaching angle measurement error to vocational high school students with different spatial ability. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest was employed. There were 197 students from three vocational high schools in the southern, northern, and eastern part of Taiwan participated in this study. To minimize the biased result, we established one control group and one experimental group in each school. The experimental group used multimedia teaching tools and AR technology as a supplement, while the control group was taught by multimedia teaching tools only. We assessed some factors that possibly affect the learning outcomes and learning satisfaction, including different spatial abilities and different digital materials as teaching tools. Our finding highlights that different teaching materials influence students' learning outcomes and satisfaction, whereas spatial ability does not affect. Further discussion and implementation are also identified in this study.},

abstract={A great deal of economic problems are related to detecting the stability of time series data, where the main interest is in the unit root test. In this paper, we consider the unit root testing problem with errors being long-memory processes with the GARCH structure. A new test statistic is developed by using the random weighted bootstrap method. It turns out that the proposed statistic has a chi-squared distribution asymptotically regardless of the process being stationary or nonstationary, and with or without an intercept term. The simulation results show that the statistic has a desired finite sample performance in terms of both size and power. A real data application is also given relying on the inflation rate data of 17 countries.},

abstract={The rapid expansion of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) into various applications has increased the demand for hands-free input interfaces when traditional control methods are inapplicable (e.g., for paralyzed individuals who cannot move their hands). Facial electromyogram (fEMG), bioelectric signals generated from facial muscles, could solve this problem. Discriminating facial gestures using fEMG is possible because fEMG signals vary with these gestures. Thus, these signals can be used to generate discrete hands-free control commands. This study implemented an fEMG-based facial gesture recognition system for generating discrete commands to control an AR or VR environment. The fEMG signals around the eyes were recorded, assuming that the fEMG electrodes were embedded into the VR head-mounted display (HMD). Sixteen discrete facial gestures were classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with Riemannian geometry features. Because the fEMG electrodes were far from the facial muscles associated with the facial gestures, some similar facial gestures were indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, this study determined the best facial gesture combinations with the highest classification accuracy for 3–15 commands. An analysis of the fEMG data acquired from 15 participants showed that the optimal facial gesture combinations increased the accuracy by 4.7%p compared with randomly selected facial gesture combinations. Moreover, this study is the first to investigate the feasibility of implementing a subject-independent facial gesture recognition system that does not require individual user training sessions. Lastly, our online hands-free control system was successfully applied to a media player to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system.},

abstract={The field of spatial cognitive training and evaluation has rapidly evolved. However, the low learning motivation and engagement of the subjects hinder the widespread use of spatial cognitive training. This study designed a home-based spatial cognitive training and evaluation system (SCTES), which aimed to train subjects on spatial cognitive tasks for 20 days, and compared the brain activities before and after the training. This study also evaluated the feasibility of using a portable all-in-one prototype for cognitive training that combined a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display with high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. During the course of training, the length of the navigation path and the distance between the starting position and the platform position revealed significant behavioral differences. In the testing sessions, the subjects showed significant behavioral differences in the time it took to complete the test task before and after training. After only four days of training, the subjects demonstrated significant differences in the Granger causality analysis (GCA) characteristics of brain regions in the Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], and Formula Omitted] frequency bands of the EEG, as well as significant differences in the GCA of the EEG in the Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], and Formula Omitted] frequency bands between the two test sessions. The proposed SCTES used a compact and all-in-one form factor to train and evaluate spatial cognition and collect EEG signals and behavioral data simultaneously. The recorded EEG data can be used to quantitatively assess the efficacy of spatial training in patients with spatial cognitive impairments.},

abstract={Classroom experiments related to investigating the centripetal force are often underrepresented in the physics teaching practice. This is largely due to the fact that schools lack the proper equipment and teachers lack the time to perform the rather tedious data collection procedures which are characteristic for some of the traditional experimental setups. A possible solution to this problem is to develop and utilize alternative experimental setups within the digital environment. In fact, earlier research has shown that new generations of students are highly motivated to learn physics in digital environments and that these environments often provide at least as efficient learning of concepts as traditional environments. In this article, we present an augmented reality Android application named CEntripetalForceAR (CEFAR) that allows students to experimentally investigate how centripetal force depends on the period of orbital motion and the orbital radius. A possible pedagogical approach to using CEFAR is also described, including suggestions on how CEFAR can be used to overcome some of the most common misconceptions related to circular motion. A user experience survey which included 163 first-year university students showed that CEFAR can be awarded an excellent usability rating. Most students stated that the application helped them to improve their understanding about centripetal force either by visualization or by the possibility to explore cause and effect relationships.},

abstract={The glutamate and γ‐aminobutyric acid neuroreceptor subtypes mGluR5 and GABAA are hypothesized to be involved in the development of a variety of psychiatric diseases. However, detailed information relating to their in vivo distribution is generally unavailable. Maps of such distributions could potentially aid clinical studies by providing a reference for the normal distribution of neuroreceptors and may also be useful as covariates in advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (MR) studies. In this study, we propose a comprehensive processing pipeline for the construction of standard space, in vivo distributions of non‐displaceable binding potential (BPND), and total distribution volume (VT) based on simultaneously acquired bolus‐infusion positron emission tomography (PET) and MR data. The pipeline was applied to 11C]ABP688‐PET/MR (13 healthy male non‐smokers, 26.6 ± 7.0 years) and 11C]Flumazenil‐PET/MR (10 healthy males, 25.8 ± 3.0 years) data. Activity concentration templates, as well as VT and BPND atlases of mGluR5 and GABAA, were generated from these data. The maps were validated by assessing the percent error δ from warped space to native space in a selection of brain regions. We verified that the average δABP = 3.0 ± 1.0% and δFMZ = 3.8 ± 1.4% were lower than the expected variabilities σ of the tracers (σABP = 4.0%–16.0%, σFMZ = 3.9%–9.5%). An evaluation of PET‐to‐PET registrations based on the new maps showed higher registration accuracy compared to registrations based on the commonly used 15O]H2O‐template distributed with SPM12. Thus, we conclude that the resulting maps can be used for further research and the proposed pipeline is a viable tool for the construction of standardized PET data distributions.},

abstract={Online magnetic resonance (MR)‐guided radiotherapy is expected to benefit brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) due to superior soft tissue contrast and capability of daily adaptive planning. The purpose of this study was to investigate daily adaptive plan quality with setup variations and to perform an end‐to‐end test for brain SRS with multiple metastases treated with a 1.5‐Tesla MR‐Linac (MRL). The RTsafe PseudoPatient Prime brain phantom was used with a delineation insert that includes two predefined structures mimicking gadolinium contrast‐enhanced brain lesions. Daily adaptive plans were generated using six preset and six random setup variations. Two adaptive plans per daily MR image were generated using the adapt‐to‐position (ATP) and adapt‐to‐shape (ATS) workflows. An adaptive patient plan was generated on a diagnostic MR image with simulated translational and rotational daily setup variation and was compared with the reference plan. All adaptive plans were compared with the reference plan using the target coverage, Paddick conformity index, gradient index (GI), Brain V12 or V20, optimization time and total monitor units. Target doses were measured as an end‐to‐end test with two ionization chambers inserted into the phantom. With preset translational variations, V12 from the ATS plan was 17% lower than that of the ATP plan. With a larger daily setup variation, GI and V12 of the ATS plan were 10% and 16% lower than those of the ATP plan, respectively. Compared to the ATP plans, the plan quality index of the ATS plans was more consistent with the reference plan, and within 5% in both phantom and patient plans. The differences between the measured and planned target doses were within 1% for both treatment workflows. Treating brain SRS using an MRL is feasible and could achieve satisfactory dosimetric goals. Setup uncertainties could be accounted for using online plan adaptation. The ATS workflow achieved better dosimetric results than the ATP workflow at the cost of longer optimization time.},

abstract={Background Foot Function Index (FFI) is a valid and reliable outcome measure, which is widely used to measure the foot and ankle functional level and disorders. Until now, no validated Arabic version of the FFI is available. This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this project was to translate and adapt the FFI into Arabic and to evaluate its psychometric properties of validity and reliability. Methods The study consisted of two phases. The first phase was the translation and cultural adaptation of the FFI to Arabic. The next phase involved, testing the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the FFI on a sample of 50 consecutive participants which included internal consistency, test–retest reliability, floor and ceiling effects and construct validity. Results The mean age of the study participants was 38 ± 12.94 years. Both the genders were evenly enrolled with 50% of the participants as male and 50% as female. Majority of them complained of plantar fasciopathy (32%) followed by pes planus (22%) and ankle sprain (18%). The scores of FFI-Ar were normally distributed, confirmed by a significant Shapiro–Wilk test. The mean value of FFI-Ar total score was 47.73 ± 19.85. There were no floor or ceiling effects seen in any of the subscales and total score. The internal consistency was good with the Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.882, 0.936 and 0.850 for the pain, disability and activity limitation subscales, respectively. The reproducibility of the FFI-Ar was analysed by intra-class correlation coefficient which revealed good to excellent test–retest reliability. A significant correlation was found between FFI-Ar and SF-36 and numeric rating scale (NRS) confirming its construct validity. Conclusion The FFI-Arabic version showed good validity and reliability in patients with foot and ankle problems. This tool can be used in usual practice and research for analysing foot and ankle disorders in Arabic-speaking people.},

abstract={Progression in digital pathology has yielded new opportunities for a remote work environment. We evaluated the utility of digital review of breast cancer immunohistochemical prognostic markers (IHC) using whole slide images (WSI) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cytology cell block specimens (CB) using three different scanners.CB from 20 patients with breast cancer diagnosis and available IHC were included. Glass slides including 20 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), 20 Estrogen Receptor (ER), 20 Progesterone Receptor (PR), 16 Androgen Receptor (AR), and 20 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) were scanned on 3 different scanners. Four breast pathologists reviewed the WSI and recorded their semi-quantitative scoring for each marker. Kappa concordance was defined as complete agreement between glass/digital pairs. Discordances between microscopic and digital reads were classified as a major when a clinically relevant change was seen. Minor discordances were defined as differences in scoring percentages/staining pattern that would not have resulted in a clinical implication. Scanner precision was tabulated according to the success rate of each scan on all three scanners.In total, we had 228 paired glass/digital IHC reads on all 3 scanners. There was strong concordance kappa ≥0.85 for all pathologists when comparing paired microscopic/digital reads. Strong concordance (kappa ≥0.86) was also seen when comparing reads between scanners.Twenty-three percent of the WSI required rescanning due to barcode detection failures, 14% due to tissue detection failures, and 2% due to focus issues. Scanner 1 had the best average precision of 92%. HER2 IHC had the lowest intra-scanner precision (64%) among all stains.This study is the first to address the utility of WSI in breast cancer IHC in CB and to validate its reporting using 3 different scanners. Digital images are reliable for breast IHC assessment in CB and offer similar reproducibility to microscope reads.},

abstract={PurposeLocalized prostate cancer (PCa) in patients is characterized by a dominant focus in the gland (dominant intraprostatic lesion, DIL). Accurate DIL identification may enable more accurate diagnosis and therapy through more precise targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy and focal ablative therapies. The goal of this study is to validate the performance of 18F]DCFPyL PET and CT perfusion (CTP) for detecting and localizing DIL against digital histopathological images.MethodsMulti-modality image sets: in vivo T2-weighted (T2w)-MRI, 22-min dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, CTP, and 2-h post-injection PET/MR were acquired in patients prior to radical prostatectomy. The explanted gland with implanted fiducial markers was imaged with T2w-MRI. All images were co-registered to the pathologist-annotated digital images of whole-mount mid-gland histology sections using fiducial markers and anatomical landmarks. Regions of interest encompassing DIL and non-DIL tissue were drawn on the digital histopathological images and superimposed on PET and CTP parametric maps. Logistic regression with backward elimination of parameters was used to select the most sensitive parameter set to distinguish DIL from non-DIL voxels. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was performed to determine diagnostic performance.Results18F]DCFPyL PET and CTP parametric maps of 15 patients were analyzed. SUVLate and a model combining Ki and k4 of 18F]DCFPyL achieved the most accurate performance distinguishing DIL from non-DIL voxels. Both detection models achieved an AUC of 0.90 and an error rate of < 10%. Compared to digital histopathology, the detected DILs had a mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 for the Ki and k4 model and 0.7 for SUVLate.ConclusionsWe have validated using co-registered digital histopathological images that parameters from kinetic analysis of 22-min dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET can accurately localize DILs in PCa for targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy, and focal ablative therapies. Short-duration dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET was not inferior to SUVLate in this diagnostic task.Clinical trial registration number: NCT04009174 (ClinicalTrials.gov).},

abstract={This work reports the self-organization of dimple nanostructures on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) surface where an Ar ion beam was irradiated at an ion energy of 600 eV. The peak-to-peak roughness and diameter of dimple nanostructures were 29.1~53.4 nm and 63.4~77.6 nm, respectively. The electron energy loss spectrum at the peaks and troughs of dimples showed similar C=C, C=O, and O=CH bonding statuses. In addition, wide-angle X-ray scattering showed that Ar ion beam irradiation did not induce crystallization of the PEN surface. That meant that the self-organization on the PEN surface could be due to the ion-induced surface instability of the amorphous layer and not due to the partial crystallinity differences of the peaks and valleys. A nonlinear continuum model described surface instability due to Ar ion-induced sputtering. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model reproduced the dimple morphologies numerically, which was similar to the experimentally observed dimple patterns. This preliminary validation showed the possibility that the continuum equation used for metal and semiconductor surfaces could be applied to polymer surfaces where ion beam sputtering occurred.},

abstract={This study aimed to test the validity of visual representations of food products in virtual reality by comparing descriptions of a set of actual vs. virtual cookies. This validation is key to future applications of virtual reality in sensory studies. Ten commercial cookies were virtualized by photogrammetry then configured inside virtual sensory booths designed using Unity and presented via a first-version HTC Vive virtual reality headset. Flash profiling was used to determine changes in relative weight of the perceptual dimensions in the product space and compare descriptions of actual vs. virtual product appearance. Conventional profiling of both actual and virtual products then served to determine whether common sensory dimensions carry the same kind of weight in both real and virtual sensory spaces and show similar ranges of difference among products. The results showed that descriptions of virtual cookies were close to descriptions of the actual cookies. Brightness carried more weight in the perceptual space of actual products whereas color contrast carried more weight in the perceptual space of virtual products. However, this difference may have arisen from software-setting configurations that could be optimized for a better match. Taken together, the results of this study offer promising perspectives for the use of virtual products in sensory and consumers studies.},

abstract={Background Arabic represents one of the most frequently spoken languages worldwide, especially among refugee populations. There is a pressing need for specialized diagnostic tools corresponding to the DSM-5 criteria in Modern Standard Arabic, which can be administered on Arabic speakers in the West and Arab region alike. Objectives To develop and validate the culturally-adapted version of the most recent M.I.N.I. 7.0.2 into Modern Standard Arabic—a form of Arabic commonly used across all Arab countries. Methods 102 participants were recruited between April 2019 to March 2020 at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin. Symptoms were assessed with Arabic versions of rater-based and self-rated measures, including Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Arabic-speaking psychiatrists saw participants for diagnostic assessment. Results Cohen’s kappa (κ) values were moderate for major depression, and slight for post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, kappa values indicated moderate agreement between M.I.N.I.-AR and PHQ-9 for depression, as well as HTQ for post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively. Conclusion The translated and culturally adapted version of the M.I.N.I. addresses an existing need for a reliable, efficient, and effective comprehensive diagnostic tool using the most recent DSM-5 criteria in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Based on the obtained results, only a validation of the depression module (Module A) of the M.I.N.I-AR was possible. Study outcomes also show evidence for the validation of Module H covering Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Potential valuable contributions can be extended to this translation and validation.},

abstract={It is very difficult to extract the feature frequency of the vibration signal of the rolling bearing early weak fault and in order to extract its feature frequency quickly and accurately. A method of extracting early weak fault vibration signal feature frequency of the rolling bearing by intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) and autoregression (AR) minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the original early weak fault vibration signal of the rolling bearing is decomposed by the ITD algorithm to proper rotations (PRs) with fault feature frequency. Then, the sample entropy value of each PR is calculated to find the largest PRs of the sample entropy. Finally, the AR-MED filtering algorithm is utilized to filter and reduce the noise of the largest PRs of the sample entropy value, and the early weak fault vibration signal feature frequency of the rolling bearing is accurately extracted. The results show that the ITD-AR-MED method can extract the early weak fault vibration signal feature frequency of the rolling bearing accurately.},

abstract={It is very important to extract the characteristic frequency of helicopter mechanical fault signal, which is directly related to the accuracy of fault diagnosis and the reliability of early fault prediction. The traditional characteristic frequency extraction of fault signal mostly uses the spectrum analysis method based on Fourier analysis.

In this paper, researchers use the AR model spectral estimation method based on the modern spectral estimation theory to study the characteristic frequency extraction of helicopter mechanical fault signal. The simulation results show that the effect is better.},

abstract={ObjectivesTo evaluate the biochemical milieu in testes with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) by using proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in detecting differences in testicular metabolites between histological stages of NOA and in assessing the possible presence of spermatozoa before microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE).MethodsForty-nine NOA men and fifty age-matched controls were included in this prospective study. A single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence with TR/TE (2000/25 ms) was used. NOA testes were classified using the higher Johnsen score (hJS) (group 1, hJS ≥ 8; and group 2, hJS < 8). Nonparametric statistical tests were used to assess differences in normalized metabolite concentrations, defined as ratios of the metabolite concentrations versus creatine concentration between (a) NOA and controls, (b) NOA groups, and (c) NOA with positive and negative sperm retrieval.ResultsNormalized concentrations of total choline (median 0.396 vs 1.09 mmol/kg, p = 0.002), myo-inositol (median 1.985 vs 3.19 mmol/kg, p = 0.002), and total lipids and macromolecules (TLM) resonating at 0.9 ppm (median 0.962 vs 2.43 mmol/kg, p = 0.024), 1.3 ppm (median 4.88 vs 10.7 mmol/kg, p = 0.043), and 2.0 ppm (median 2.33 vs 5.96 mmol/kg, p = 0.007) were reduced in NOA testes compared with controls. Decreased concentrations of TLM 2.0 (median 3.755 vs 0.436 mmol/kg, p = 0.043) were found in group 2 compared with group 1. Increased normalized concentrations of glutamate were observed in NOA testes with failed sperm retrieval (median 0.321 vs 0.000 mmol/kg, p = 0.028).Conclusions1H-MRS provides metabolic information about the testis in NOA patients and assesses spermatogenic status before mTESE.Key Points• NOA testes differed from age-matched controls, in terms of reduced normalized concentrations of tChol, mI, and lipids.• TLM 2.0 peaks were found useful in the identification of NOA testes with the presence of foci of advanced spermatogenesis up to the haploid gamete stage.• Glu proved a reliable metabolic signature of spermatogenesis in NOA population by assessing the possible presence of sperm after mTESE.},

abstract={Mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is important for human thermal comfort indexes, but is difficult to determine. Tmrt was calculated from measured temperatures of buildings and vegetation surfaces in urban scenarios along with meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity and global radiation). The method can be used for experimental work in urban settings without the use of four-flux net radiometers. Tmrt for different positions in the urban canyon can be calculated. A software package named Mr.T was developed which allows determining Tmrt from data input manually or from EXCEL spreadsheets. The software was validated in two urban settings: in Tel Aviv University and a nearby urban canyon in summer and in the old city quarter of Beer Sheva at the end of winter. Results were close to those obtained with a four-flux net radiometer. Differences in calculated and measured fluxes are discussed as well as sources of errors in the calculations. Assumption of clear skies for the computation of atmospheric radiation did not introduce significant errors. A priori values of albedo and emissivity of the different urban surfaces can have large effects on fluxes and radiant temperatures, and the use of tables of those values is probably a large source of uncertainty when using the calculation procedure. In conclusion, the software developed can be a significant tool for the study of thermal comfort conditions in urban settings.},

abstract={PurposeGlioma treatment planning requires precise tumor delineation, which is typically performed with contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI. However, CE MRI fails to reflect the entire extent of glioma. O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET may detect tumor volumes missed by CE MRI. We investigated the clinical value of simultaneous FET-PET and CE MRI in delineating tumor extent before treatment planning. Guided stereotactic biopsy was used to validate the findings.MethodsConventional MRI and 18F-FET PET were performed simultaneously on a hybrid PET/MR in 33 patients with histopathologically confirmed glioma. Tumor volumes were quantified using a tumor-to-brain ratio ≥ 1.6 (VPET) and a visual threshold (VCE). We visually assessed abnormal areas on FLAIR images and calculated Dice’s coefficient (DSC), overlap volume (OV), discrepancy-PET, and discrepancy-CE. Additionally, several stereotactic biopsy samples were taken from “matched” or “mismatched” FET-PET and CE MRI regions.ResultsAmong 31 patients (93.94%), FET-PET delineated significantly larger tumor volumes than CE MRI (77.84 ± 51.74 cm3 vs. 34.59 ± 27.07 cm3, P < 0.05). Of the 21 biopsy samples obtained from regions with increased FET uptake, all were histopathologically confirmed as glioma tissue or tumor infiltration, whereas only 13 showed enhancement on CE MRI. Among all patients, the spatial similarity between VPET and VCE was low (average DSC 0.56 ± 0.22), while the overlap was high (average OV 0.95 ± 0.08). The discrepancy-CE and discrepancy-PET were lower than 10% in 28 and 0 patients, respectively. Eleven patients showed VPET partially beyond abnormal signal areas on FLAIR images.ConclusionThe metabolically active biodistribution of gliomas delineated with FET-PET significantly exceeds tumor volume on CE MRI, and histopathology confirms these findings. Our preliminary results indicate that combining the anatomic and molecular information obtained from conventional MRI and FET-PET would reveal a more accurate glioma extent, which is critical for individualized treatment planning.},

abstract={In the linear regression model, the errors are usually assumed to be uncorrelated. However, in real-life data, this assumption is not often plausible. In this study, first, we will assume that the errors of the regression model have autoregressive structure. This type of regression models has been considered before. However, in those papers under this assumption usually, the symmetric distributions are used as error distribution. The main contribution of this work is to use skew distributions instead of symmetric distributions as error distribution in regression models with autoregressive errors. We provide expectation maximization algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters. The performances of the proposed estimators are demonstrated with a simulation study and a real data example. We also provide the confidence intervals using the observed Fisher information matrix for the corresponding estimators.},

abstract={Australian terranes concealed beneath Mesozoic cover record complex Precambrian tectonic histories involving a successive development of several Proterozoic to Palaeozoic orogenic systems. This study presents an integrated approach combining K–Ar, 40Ar–39Ar, and Rb–Sr geochronologies of Precambrian authigenic illites from the recently discovered Millungera Basin in north-central Australia. Brittle deformation and repeated fault activity are evident from the sampled cores and their microstructures, probably associated with the large-scale faults inferred from interpretations of seismic surveys. Rb–Sr isochron, 40Ar–39Ar total gas, and K–Ar ages are largely consistent in indicating late Mesoproterozoic and early Proterozoic episodes (∼1115±26, ∼ 1070±25, ∼1040±24, ∼1000±23, and ∼905±21 Ma) of active tectonics in north-central Australia. K–Ar results show that illites from fault gouges and authigenic matrix illites in undeformed adjacent sandstones precipitated contemporaneously, indicating that advection of tectonically mobilized fluids extended into the undeformed wall rocks above or below the fracture and shear (fault gouge) zones. Isotopic age data clearly indicate a Mesoproterozoic minimum age for the Millungera Basin and thus previously unrecorded late Mesoproterozoic–early Neoproterozoic tectonic events in north-central Australia. This study provides insight into the enigmatic time–space distribution of Precambrian tectonic zones in central Australia, which are responsible for the formation of a number of sedimentary basins with significant energy and mineral resources.},

abstract={Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) affect millions of people worldwide. Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) is a valid and reliable tool to assess the health of patients with MSD. However, this scale is not available in the Arabic language. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) into Arabic (MSK-HQ-Ar) and evaluate its validity and reliability among participants with MSD. Methods: This cross-sectional study used guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) to translate as well as validate the psychometric properties of MSK-HQ-Ar. Patients with MSD (n = 149) living in Taif participated in the study. Cronbach’s alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to assess internal consistency and test-retest reliability of MSK-HQ-Ar respectively. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the correlation between MSK-HQ-Ar and the European quality of life five-dimension, five-level scale (EQ-5D-5L). Results: Out of 149 participants, 119 completed the MSK-HQ-Ar twice. The scale showed good internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha (0.88), and reliability (ICC 0.92–0.95). A strong association was found with the EQ-5D-5L scores. Conclusion: The adapted MSK-HQ-Arabic version revealed acceptable psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable outcome measure to assess MSK health among Arabic speaking patients with MSD.},

abstract={The complete automation of software tests has been considered to be an unattainable goal. This article discusses the potential to achieve this goal with recent discoveries and innovations in the areas of virtual reality (VR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, a theoretical proposal is described to integrate the properties of each of these areas using a process of automation of software tests. This process is based on a classification and description of the properties after consulting the literature, interviews, and dialogs with specialists from Australia, the United States, Germany, and Colombia. In addition to the experiences of the researchers, the construction of two tools is proposed: (1) a robot to design and apply functional tests, and (2) a virtual machine to identify errors in the logical structure of the code. Both tools are expected to replace human factors; the advantage is that the first tool identifies procedural flaws and the second errors of operation.},

abstract={There are major concerns about the suitability of immersive virtual reality (VR) systems (i.e., head-mounted display; HMD) to be implemented in research and clinical settings, because of the presence of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, and instability (i.e., VR induced symptoms and effects; VRISE). Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the presence and intensity of VRISE, but there are no suggestions regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The implementation of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and report both the quality of software features and VRISE intensity quantitatively. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire (VRNQ) was developed to assess the quality of VR software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty participants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study. They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions should be between 55 and 70 min when the VR software meets or exceeds the parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the VR system. Also, the gaming experience does not seem to affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially modulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion, better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity. The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs may appraise the suitability of VR software for implementation in research and clinical settings. The findings of this study contribute to the establishment of rigorous VR methods that are crucial for the viability of immersive VR as a research and clinical tool in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.},

abstract={PurposeMaximising the benefit of learning from defects is regarded by UK housing associations (HAs) as a key opportunity to meet their challenges of building more homes with reduced government funding and rent incomes. Despite learning from defects being a frequent recommendation to reduce defects in the construction literature, there is scarce empirical evidence into how HAs actually learn from defects. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how HAs learn from past defects and induce change to reduce defects.Design/methodology/approachGuided by organisational learning (OL) as the theoretical lens, a 21-month action research (AR) project explored one HA’s defects management and learning processes.FindingsOL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task which is reliant on a defects management team analysing defect data to identify priority areas. As such, learning from defects can be reduced due to peaks in workload if data analysis is a manual process. Furthermore, a dual learning approach plays a significant role for HA’s learning consisting of designing out defects (codification) supported by networking (personalisation) to tackle issues of workmanship on site and those defects that cannot be designed out.Originality/valueThis study demonstrates OL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task in HA’s practice; and highlights the practical challenges of academia and industry co-production in AR in construction.},

abstract={ObjectivesIn utero magnetic resonance (iuMR) imaging to diagnose foetal brain abnormalities has been established and is supported by meta-analyses of retrospective and prospective studies. In this paper we describe and classify the iuMR errors made in the largest diagnostic accuracy study to date (MERIDIAN). We also correlate the error rates and types with the prior experience of the reporting radiologists in order to inform how to provide a national programme with the best diagnostic accuracy achievable.MethodsThe MERIDIAN cohort of 570 foetus formed the basis of this study and included 40 cases with a confirmed diagnostic error, compared with the Outcome Reference Diagnosis. Analysis included the potential clinical effect of the error and classification of error type through an Expert Neuroradiological Panel re-reporting the study. Assessments were made regarding radiologists experience prior to MERIDIAN.ResultsThe overall confirmed error rate for iuMR was 7·0% and it was considered that there would have been an adverse effect on prognostic information in 22/40 cases if the iuMR had informed counselling. The experienced central reporter made statistically significant fewer errors than the less experienced non-central reporters (3·8% v 11·0%) and the central reporter made fewer clinically significant errors. Furthermore, the type of cognitive errors differed between central and non-central reporters.ConclusionsAlthough iuMR imaging improves the diagnostic accuracy of detecting foetal brain abnormalities there remains a substantial error rate, which can have major clinical significance. We have shown that error rates are lower for more experienced reporting radiologists with fewer potential deleterious clinical implications. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of providing a uniform national service.Key Points• Overall confirmed error rate for iuMR diagnosing foetal brain abnormalities was 7·0%.• IuMR reports had an adverse effect on counselling in 55% of error cases.• Error rates are consistently lower for more experienced radiologists.• Collaboration between radiologists, dual reporting, overseeing scan and formal training can reduce errors.},

abstract={Software testing is regarded as an important method for fault revealing. Despite this advantage, it has been poorly used within the scope of virtual reality (VR) applications because they are highly complex and have peculiar features. Most testing performed of this VR applications are usability, which is conducted manually and only at final of the development process. Although some works try to propose criteria for this domain, there are no approaches that automatize the generation of test data from requirements specification in the VR domain. This paper proposes an approach called virtual reality—requirements specification and testing (VR‐ReST) to assist the requirements specification through a semiformal language and uses structural test criteria to generate test requirements and test data automatically for VR applications using scene graph concepts. The paper also examines the empirical results concerning the cost‐effectiveness of the approach for three different VR applications through two experiments. Mutation testing was used to evaluate effectiveness. We found that the approach achieved a high mutation score outperforming random testing, by 20%, on average. Our results also demonstrate that the approach is promising since it assists in writing and validating the requirements, as well as in reducing the risks of requirement specification by adopting a semiformal language.},

abstract={AimThe aim was to design an app-based eLearning tool to provide radiographers with information about the physical basis of MR artefacts and practical elimination or/and minimisation strategies to optimise image quality, and to evaluate the impact of a smartphone app on radiographers’ knowledge.MethodsThe study used the comparison-experimental approach (pre- and post-test). Thirty-five MR radiographers independently reviewed a prepared series of MR images (n = 25). The participants were requested to identify image quality related errors, to specify error-correction strategies and to score how confident they were in their responses. Participants were then divided into experimental (n = 19) and control cohorts (n = 16). The app was provided to the experimental cohort for 3 months; after this period both cohorts re-reviewed the MR image datasets and repeated their identification of image quality errors.ResultsThe results showed a statistically significant difference between control and experimental cohorts relative to participants’ pre- to post-test knowledge level. For the experimental cohort, years of experience, qualification and type of hospital were not associated with radiographer knowledge level and confidence in recognising the presence of an image quality error, naming the error and specifying appropriate correction strategies (p > 0.05).ConclusionThe study identified the potential of the smartphone app as an effective educational tool to support MR radiographers’ knowledge in recognising and characterising MR image quality errors.Key Points• A high level of knowledge to optimise MR image quality is crucial.• Ongoing education in image quality optimisation is required.• The potential role of app as an effective educational tool is identified.},

abstract={PurposeThe accurate diagnosis of spondylolysis is widely made with CT scan considered as the gold standard. However, CT represents significant radiation exposure particularly substantial in a young and sometimes still growing population. Although the role of MRI in identifying edema/inflammation within the pars as an active lesion is proved, its ability to demonstrate and classify pars fracture line as same as CT is still controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to determine sensitivity and specificity of MRI in the direct visualisation of the pars defect.MethodsThe PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched for relevant studies from the earliest researchable time to December 2016 for cases in which the accuracy of MRI was reported for the diagnosis of spondylolysis in young patients. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality for each selected study using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. A meta-analysis of the reported sensitivity and specificity of pooled data of selected studies was performed by a systematic review. For each selected study, sensitivity and specificity was recalculated, by considering only direct visualisation of a fracture line of the pars. The hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to estimate the diagnostic performance of MR imaging. Heterogeneity was also tested.ResultsThe systematic review identified 4 out of a total of 1300 studies to be included in the meta-analysis. On a per-pars basis (a total of 1122 pars), the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the MRI for the direct diagnosis of a pars defect were 81% (95% CI 54–94%) and 99% (95% CI 98–100%), respectively. A high overall heterogeneity (I2 = 79.5%) was computed with respective high and low heterogeneity on sensitivity (I2 = 87.9%) and specificity (I2 = 38.4%).ConclusionsThis meta-analysis demonstrated a high diagnostic performance of MR imaging for the diagnosis of a pars defect in young adults. This technique may be considered as a first-line imaging technique as it helps to avoid exposure to ionising radiation.},

abstract={In the present prospective study, the functional outcomes of non-operative treatment were evaluated in patients aged between 30 and 45 years presenting SLAP lesion in diagnostic provocative tests and magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography. Forty-six patients with a symptomatic SLAP lesion who participated in recreational level of sports were prospectively enroled. SLAP lesion was diagnosed using combinations of several clinical tests and MR arthrography findings. All patients were treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections, followed by rotator cuff and periscapular muscle-strengthening exercises. Patients with persistent discomfort after second injection underwent arthroscopic SLAP repair. Functional outcomes were evaluated using ASES and Constant scores, and pain and satisfaction for visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain had significantly improved from 5.2 ± 2.2 to 1.0 ± 1.1 (p < 0.001) in all patients after the first corticosteroid injection. SLAP symptoms relapsed in 12 patients at an average of 2.4 months after the first injection. Symptoms were relieved in 5 of 12 patients after the second injection and strengthening exercises. The remaining seven patients underwent arthroscopic SLAP repair. Thirty-nine patients (85 %) who were treated non-operatively showed improved VAS, Constant, and ASES scores at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Non-operative treatment with an appropriate regimen provided satisfactory clinical outcomes in middle-aged patients with symptomatic SLAP lesions and should be considered before recommending operative treatment. Non-operative management using combined intra-articular corticosteroid injection with rotator cuff and periscapular strengthening exercises could be applied as primary treatment for patients with symptomatic SLAP lesion who participate in recreational level of sports.

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of defective positron emission tomography (PET) detectors on clinical PET image quality in simultaneous PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for both time-of-flight (TOF) and non-TOF reconstructed images. Procedures A total of six patients with various malignant tumors were included and underwent a 2-deoxy-2-18F]fluoro-d-glucose PET scan in a fully functional simultaneous TOF PET/MRI. TOF and non-TOF PET images were reconstructed before and after simulating defective detector units. All images were clinically assessed and scored. In addition, a quantitative assessment was performed. Differences were ascertained and compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test. Results Without TOF, the image artifacts introduced by one defective detector unit already started to degrade the overall image quality. It reduced the confidence and could lead to a change in diagnosis. Simulating three or five defective detector units resulted in more artifacts and further reduced overall image quality and confidence. By including TOF information, the effects were mitigated: Images reconstructed with one defective detector unit had similar scores as the ones without defective units. The average absolute percentage error for one, three, and five defective detector units were respectively 8, 20, and 37 % for the non-TOF cases and only 5, 11, and 19 % for the TOF cases. Conclusion Our study indicates that PET image artifacts due to (simulated) defective detectors are significantly mitigated with the integration of TOF information in simultaneous PET/MR. One defective detector unit introduces, on average, a 5 % absolute percentage error. However, in TOF imaging, even in cases with one or three defective units for head and neck imaging and one defective unit for chest and abdominal imaging, overall image quality, artifact scoring, and reader confidence are not significantly degraded.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore differences in image quality between PET/MR and PET/CT hybrid imaging systems using standard quality control and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) tests. METHODS Image acquisition and quality control tests were investigated according to the standards of NEMA NU 2-2007 using NEMA phantom and recommended image acquisition techniques. The phantom consists of lesion-like hot spheres of diameters 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm filled with 8:1 18F activity ratio to background. The remaining 28 and 37 mm cold spheres were filled with water only. A 700-mm linear line source was prepared with 3.08 mCi (140.6 MBq), and all essential ROIs were drawn after image acquisition to calculate contrast. RESULTS In PET/MR, the average contrast of 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm diameter hot spheres in the phantom was 56%, 72%, 78%, and 85%, respectively. While the contrast of 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm diameter hot spheres in PET/CT was 53%, 66%, 72%, and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSION PET/MR image contrast was higher than PET/CT by 9%.},

abstract={The characteristics of a dual-pulse shock caused by an UNDEX (underwater explosion) are described through many standards. Shock signals required to evaluate the survivability of equipment by a shock test machine are also described. To generate various types of shock signals described in the standard, Shock test machines (STMs) require adjustment to various levels of shock occurring in surface ships and submarines. Therefore, the characteristics of each component of a STM should be changeable to generate various shock signals. This paper describes the concept of a STM that can generate various types of dual-pulse shocks. Moreover, this paper suggests an analytic method to determine the characteristics of each component of a STM to generate the required shock signal for various specimens. A method for adjusting the shock signals using a magnetorheological damper is specifically suggested. The results of dynamic analysis using the characteristic values of each component determined by this method shows that the required shock signal can be generated by this concept of the shock test machine.},

abstract={Background Up to 80 % of cartilage is water; the rest is collagen fibers and proteoglycans. Magnetic resonance (MR) T1-weighted measurements can be employed to calculate the water content of a tissue using T1 mapping. In this study, a method that translates T1 values into water content data was tested statistically. Materials and methods To develop a predictive equation, T1 values were obtained for tissue-mimicking gelatin samples. 1.5 T MRI was performed using inverse angle phase and an inverse sequence at 37 (±0.5) °C. Regions of interest were manually delineated and the mean T1 value was estimated in arbitrary units. Data were collected and modeled using linear regression. To validate the method, articular cartilage from six healthy pigs was used. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the Danish Animal Experiment Committee. Double measurements were performed for each animal. Ex vivo, all water in the tissue was extracted by lyophilization, thus allowing the volume of water to be measured. This was then compared with the predicted water content via Lin's concordance correlation coefficient at the 95 % confidence level. Results The mathematical model was highly significant when compared to a null model (p < 0.0001). 97.3 % of the variation in water content can be explained by absolute T1 values. Percentage water content could be predicted as 0.476 + (T1 value) × 0.000193 × 100 %. We found that there was 98 % concordance between the actual and predicted water contents. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate that MR data can be used to predict percentage water contents of cartilage samples. Level of evidence 3 (case-control study).},

Computer models were created using intra-operative US images, post-treatment follow-up MR images and clinical data from six patients receiving IRE.

Simulation estimates of injury to the neurovascular bundle and rectum were compared with clinical follow-up and patient reported outcomes. At the electric field strength of 700 V/cm, simulation estimated electric field distribution was not different from the ablation defect seen on follow-up MR imaging (p = 0.43). Simulation predicted cross sectional area of treatment (mean 532.33 ± 142.32 mm^sup 2^) corresponded well with the treatment zone seen on MR imaging (mean 540.16 ± 237.13 mm^sup 2^). Simulation results did not suggest injury to the rectum or neurovascular bundle, matching clinical follow-up at 3 months. Computer simulation estimated zone of irreversible electroporation in the prostate at 700 V/cm was comparable to measurements made on follow-up MR imaging. Numerical simulation may aid treatment planning for irreversible electroporation of the prostate in patients.},

abstract={The Jiaojia Fault (JJF) in the Jiaodong area of eastern China is an important NNE-trending structure that is subsidiary to the regional Tancheng-Lujiang (Tan-Lu) Fault Zone, and hosts >1200 t of gold reserves contained in disseminated and stockwork ore, dominantly in the footwall of the fault. We present new zircon U-Pb, apatite fission track, and illite K-Ar data along the JJF and have delineated its tectonic history focusing on its formation and reactivation. Zircon U-Pb dating shows that the Shangzhuang granite is a composite body with ages between 132±1 and 127±1 Ma. Illite K-Ar ages for the fault's gouge range from 83±2 to 68±2 Ma, and the measured apatite fission track ages for ores are between 55 and 21 Ma. Previous zircon U-Pb geochronology and structural studies suggest that the JJF was originally activated in the Jurassic during 160-150 Ma as a sinistral fault. The JJF was a normal fault in the Early Cretaceous due to NW-SE orientated tension and NE-SW compression, which lasted from 135 to 120 Ma. This was followed by sinistral strike-slip faulting due to NW-SE compression and NE-SW tension during 120-110 Ma, and it changed to normal displacement at ca. 110 Ma. Our apatite fission track data analysis and thermal modeling of representative samples suggest that there was a subsequent dextral reactivation of the fault at ca. 55 Ma. Previous age data of ca. 130-110 Ma for gold mineralization along the JJF coincides with the Early Cretaceous magmatism and is coeval with the transition from normal faulting to sinistral strike-slip faulting of the JJF in Early Cretaceous, which is interpreted to be due to changing direction of the subducting Pacific Plate.},

abstract={The EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI is distorted by a number of artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts, associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat, reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However, a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused by the Helium cooling pump, and propose a method for its reduction and respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since the Helium cooling pump artefact was found to be repetitive, an average template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact spectral peaks by 95 ± 2 % while the background spectral amplitude within those peaks was reduced by only -5 ± 4 %. Although the Helium cooling pump should ideally be switched off during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post processing.},

abstract={Radio-frequency coil arrays using dipole antenna technique have been recently applied for ultrahigh field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to obtain the better signal–noise-ratio (SNR) gain at the deep area of human tissues. However, the unique structure of dipole antennas makes it challenging to achieve sufficient electromagnetic decoupling among the dipole antenna elements. Currently, there is no decoupling methods proposed for dipole antenna arrays in MR imaging. The recently developed magnetic wall (MW) or induced current elimination decoupling technique has demonstrated its feasibility and robustness in designing microstrip transmission line arrays, L/C loop arrays and monopole arrays. In this study, we aim to investigate the possibility and performance of MW decoupling technique in dipole arrays for MR imaging at the ultrahigh field of 7T. To achieve this goal, a two-channel MW decoupled dipole array was designed, constructed and analyzed experimentally through bench test and MR imaging. Electromagnetic isolation between the two dipole elements was improved from about −3.6 dB (without any decoupling treatments) to −16.5 dB by using the MW decoupling method. MR images acquired from a water phantom using the MW decoupled dipole array and the geometry factor maps were measured, calculated and compared with those acquired using the dipole array without decoupling treatments. The MW decoupled dipole array demonstrated well-defined image profiles from each element and had better geometry factor over the array without decoupling treatments. The experimental results indicate that the MW decoupling technique might be a promising solution to reducing the electromagnetic coupling of dipole arrays in ultrahigh field MRI, consequently improving their performance in SNR and parallel imaging.},

abstract={The level set approach to segmentation of medical images has received considerable attention in recent years. Evolving an initial contour to converge to anatomical boundaries of an organ or tumor is a very appealing method, especially when it is based on a well-defined mathematical foundation. However, one drawback of such evolving method is its high computation time. It is desirable to design and implement algorithms that are not only accurate and robust but also fast in execution. Bresson et al. have proposed a variational model using both boundary and region information as well as shape priors. The latter can be a significant factor in medical image analysis. In this work, we combine the variational model of level set with a multi-resolution approach to accelerate the processing. The question is whether a multi-resolution context can make the segmentation faster without affecting the accuracy. As well, we investigate the question whether a premature convergence, which happens in a much shorter time, would reduce accuracy. We examine multiple semiautomated configurations to segment the prostate gland in T2W MR images. Comprehensive experimentation is conducted using a data set of a 100 patients (1,235 images) to verify the effectiveness of the multi-resolution level set with shape priors. The results show that the convergence speed can be increased by a factor of asymptotically =]2.5 without affecting the segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, a premature convergence approach drastically increases the segmentation speed by a factor of asymptotically =]17.9.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Objectives In cases of “spina bifida,” a detailed prenatal imaging assessment of the exact morphology of neural tube defects (NTD) is often limited. Due to the diverse clinical prognosis and prenatal treatment options, imaging parameters that support the prenatal differentiation between open and closed neural tube defects (ONTDs and CNTDs) are required. This fetal MR study aims to evaluate the clivus-supraocciput angle (CSA) and the maximum transverse diameter of the posterior fossa (TDPF) as morphometric parameters to aid in the reliable diagnosis of either ONTDs or CNTDs. Methods The TDPF and the CSA of 238 fetuses (20–37 GW, mean: 28.36 GW) with a normal central nervous system, 44 with ONTDS, and 13 with CNTDs (18–37 GW, mean: 24.3 GW) were retrospectively measured using T2-weighted 1.5 Tesla MR -sequences. Results Normal fetuses showed a significant increase in the TDPF (r = .956; p<.001) and CSA (r = .714; p<.001) with gestational age. In ONTDs the CSA was significantly smaller (p<.001) than in normal controls and CNTDs, whereas in CNTDs the CSA was not significantly smaller than in controls (p = .160). In both ONTDs and in CNTDs the TDPF was significantly different from controls (p<.001). Conclusions The skull base morphology in fetuses with ONTDs differs significantly from cases with CNTDs and normal controls. This is the first study to show that the CSA changes during gestation and that it is a reliable imaging biomarker to distinguish between ONTDs and CNTDs, independent of the morphology of the spinal defect.},

In 235 consecutive patients aged 65.7±7.9 years; median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 8 ng/ml] with multiparametric prostate MRI (mp-MRI), 566 lesions were scored according to PI-RADS. Histology of all lesions was obtained by targeted MR-guided in-bore biopsy. In 200 lesions, biopsy revealed prostate cancer (PCa). The area under the curve (AUC) for cancer detection was 0.70 (T2WI), 0.80 (DWI), and 0.74 (DCE). A combination of T2WI + DWI, T2WI + DCE, and DWI + DCE achieved an AUC of 0.81, 0.78, and 0.79. A summed PI-RADS score of T2WI + DWI + DCE achieved an AUC of 0.81. For higher grade PCa (primary Gleason pattern≥4), the AUC was 0.85 for T2WI + DWI, 0.84 for T2WI + DCE, 0.86 for DWI + DCE, and 0.87 for T2WI + DWI + DCE. The AUC for T2WI + DWI + DCE for transitional-zone PCa was 0.73, and for the peripheral zone 0.88. Regarding higher-grade PCa, AUC for transitional-zone PCa was 0.88, and for peripheral zone 0.96. The combination of T2WI + DWI + DCE achieved the highest test accuracy, especially in patients with higher-grade PCa. The use of <=2 MR sequences led to lower AUC in higher-grade and peripheral-zone cancers. * T2WI + DWI + DCE achieved the highest accuracy in patients with higher grade PCa * T2WI + DWI + DCE was more accurate for peripheral- than for transitional-zone PCa * DCE increased PCa detection accuracy in the peripheral zone * DWI was the leading sequence in the transitional zone PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Background Reconstruction methods for Non-Cartesian magnetic resonance imaging have often been analyzed using the root mean square error (RMSE). However, RMSE is not able to measure the level of structured error associated with the reconstruction process. Methods An index for geometric information loss was presented using the 2D autocorrelation function. The performances of Least Squares Non Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (LS-NUFFT) and gridding reconstruction (GR) methods were compared. The Direct Summation method (DS) was used as reference. For both methods, RMSE and the loss in geometric information were calculated using a digital phantom and a hyperpolarized13C dataset. Results The performance of the geometric information loss index was analyzed in the presence of noise. Comparing to GR, LS-NUFFT obtained a lower RMSE, but its error image appeared more structured. This was observed in both phantom and in vivo experiments. Discussion The evaluation of geometric information loss together with the reconstruction error was important for an appropriate performance analysis of the reconstruction methods. The use of geometric information loss was helpful to determine that LS-NUFFT loses relevant information in the reconstruction process, despite the low RMSE.},

abstract={Relevant sample quantities such as the sample autocorrelation function and extremes contain useful information about autoregressive time series with heteroskedastic errors. As these quantities usually depend on the tail index of the underlying heteroskedastic time series, estimating the tail index becomes an important task. Since the tail index of such a model is determined by a moment equation, one can estimate the underlying tail index by solving the sample moment equation with the unknown parameters being replaced by their quasi-maximum likelihood estimates. To construct a confidence interval for the tail index, one needs to estimate the complicated asymptotic variance of the tail index estimator, however. In this paper the asymptotic normality of the tail index estimator is first derived, and a profile empirical likelihood method to construct a confidence interval for the tail index is then proposed. A simulation study shows that the proposed empirical likelihood method works better than the bootstrap method in terms of coverage accuracy, especially when the process is nearly nonstationary.

The LS+AR model is recognized as one of the best models for polar motion prediction. Through statistical analysis of the time series of the LS+AR model's short-term prediction residuals, we found that there is a good correlation of model prediction residuals between adjacent terms. These indicate that the preceding model prediction residuals and experiential adjustment matrixes can be used to correct the next prediction results, thereby forming a new LS+AR model with additional error correction that applies to polar motion prediction. Simulated predictions using this new model revealed that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and reliability of polar motion prediction. In fact, the accuracies of ultra short-term and short-term predictions using the new model were equal to the international best level at present.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Introduction Low muscle mass secondary to disease and ageing is an important cause of excess mortality and morbidity. Many studies include a MR brain scan but no peripheral measure of muscle mass. We developed a technique to measure posterior neck muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) on volumetric MR brain scans enabling brain and muscle size to be measured simultaneously. Methods We performed four studies to develop and test: feasibility, inter-rater reliability, repeatability and external validity. We used T1-weighted MR brain imaging from young and older subjects, obtained on different scanners, and collected mid-thigh MR data. Results After developing the technique and demonstrating feasibility, we tested it for inter-rater reliability in 40 subjects. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between raters were 0.99 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.98–1.00) for the combined group (trapezius, splenius and semispinalis), 0.92 (CI 0.85–0.96) for obliquus and 0.92 (CI 0.85–0.96) for sternocleidomastoid. The first unrotated principal component explained 72.2% of total neck muscle CSA variance and correlated positively with both right (r = 0.52, p = .001) and left (r = 0.50, p = .002) grip strength. The 14 subjects in the repeatability study had had two MR brain scans on three different scanners. The ICC for between scanner variation for total neck muscle CSA was high at 0.94 (CI 0.86–0.98). The ICCs for within scanner variations were also high, with values of 0.95 (CI 0.86–0.98), 0.97 (CI 0.92–0.99) and 0.96 (CI 0.86–0.99) for the three scanners. The external validity study found a correlation coefficient for total thigh CSA and total neck CSA of 0.88. Discussion We present a feasible, valid and reliable method for measuring neck muscle CSA on T1-weighted MR brain scans. Larger studies are needed to validate and apply our technique with subjects differing in age, ethnicity and geographical location.},

abstract={Magnetic resonance‐guided high‐intensity focused ultrasound (MR‐HIFU) is a noninvasive image‐guided technique used to thermally ablate solid tumors. During treatment, ultrasound reflections from distal media interfaces can shift prescribed treatment locations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of normal incidence reflections from air, acrylic (modeling bone), and rubber on treatment location, temperature elevation, and heating patterns by performing ultrasound exposures in a tissue‐mimicking phantom and in ex vivo porcine tissue using a clinical MR‐HIFU platform. The results demonstrated a shift in treatment location toward the distal interface when targeted closer than 2 cm from the interface, especially for acrylic. Our study demonstrated that the ultrasound wave reflections from a distal air interface had less effect than the acrylic interface (modeling bone) on the heating pattern and focal location. This study provides useful information to better understand the limitations and safety concerns of performing MR‐HIFU treatments with commercial clinical equipment.PACS numbers: 87.61.‐c, 87.63.D},

abstract={Doc number: 150 Abstract Background: Clematichinenoside AR is a promising lead compound for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A systematic research for the related impurities in AR bulk samples is still lacking. For the safe use of this natural product in future clinical practice, the structure and content of each constituent, including the main ingredient as well as the impurities in AR bulk sample must be characterized in detail. Results: A simple and stability indicating RP-HPLC method was developed and validated for determining the purity of clematichinenoside AR (AR), a natural product from the roots of Clematis manshurica Rupr. (Ranunculaceae) with the potential of treating rheumatoid arthritis. Five impurities were characterized, and impurity 2 (Clematomandshurica saponin F) is a new triterpenoid saponin isolated from this product. Optimum separation for clematichinenoside AR and five related impurities was carried out on an Agilent octadecylsilane bonded silica gel column (TC-C18, 4.6 mm ×150 mm, 5 μm) using a gradient HPLC method. The validation results showed good sensitivity, specificity, linearity(r2 >0.9992) precision(RSD<1.63%), accuracy(recoveries in the range of 95.60%-104.76%) and robustness. Three AR bulk samples containing all the impurities were examined by two methods, and the stability of correction factors for the determination of related impurities was discussed. The proposed stability-indicating method was suitable for the quality control of this natural product. Conclusion: Five related impurities of clematichinenoside AR were characterized, including a new triterpenoid saponins firstly found in clematichinenoside AR bulk samples. In the simple chromatographic method for determining clematichinenoside AR and its related impurities in bulk samples, the correction factor was better for the quality control in the relative stable concentrations.},

Background- There is a need for improved screening methods for spatial neglect. Aim- To construct a VR-test battery and evaluate its accuracy and usability in patients with acute stroke. Method- VR-DiSTRO consists of a standard desktop computer, a CRT monitor and eye shutter stereoscopic glasses, a force feedback interface, and software, developed to create an interactive and immersive 3D experience. VR-tests were developed and validated to the conventional Star Cancellation test, Line bisection, Baking Tray Task (BTT), and Visual Extinction test. A construct validation to The Rivermead Behavioral Inattention Test, used as criterion of visuospatial neglect, was made. Usability was assessed according to ISO 9241-11. Results- Thirty-one patients with stroke were included, 9/31 patients had neglect. The sensitivity was 100% and the specificity 82% for the VR-DiSTRO to correctly identify neglect. VR-BTT and VR-Extinction had the highest correlation (r2=0.64 and 0.78), as well as high sensitivity and specificity. The kappa values describing the agreement between traditional neglect tests and the corresponding virtual reality test were between 0.47-0.85. Usability was assessed by a questionnaire; 77% reported that the VR-DiSTRO was 'easy' to use. Eighty-eight percent reported that they felt 'focused', 'pleased' or 'alert'. No patient had adverse symptoms. The test session took 15min. Conclusions- The VR-DiSTRO quickly and with a high accuracy identified visuospatial neglect in patients with stroke in this construct validation. The usability among elderly patients with stroke was high. This VR-test battery has the potential to become an important screening instrument for neglect and a valuable adjunct to the neuropsychological assessment.},

This paper presents a methodology for the development of SFCSs that is based on virtual reality (VR) in order to assist the system designer at each stage of development. Exploiting VR helps the user to collect valid information quickly and in a correct form by putting the user and the information support elements in direct relation with the operation of the system in a more realistic environment. A VR-SFCS prototype tool is designed as a software system to realize the features outlined in each phase of the methodology. A set of rules and a knowledge base is appended to the methodology to remove any inconsistency that could arise between the material and the information flows during the development. A novel environment for matching the physical and the informational model domains is recommended in order to delineate the system requirements specification.},

abstract={Multimodal approaches are of growing interest in the study of neural processes. To this end much attention has been paid to the integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data because of their complementary properties. However, the simultaneous acquisition of both types of data causes serious artifacts in the EEG, with amplitudes that may be much larger than those of EEG signals themselves. The most challenging of these artifacts is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, caused by pulse-related electrode movements inside the magnetic field. Despite numerous efforts to find a suitable approach to remove this artifact, still a considerable discrepancy exists between current EEG-fMRI studies. This paper attempts to clarify several methodological issues regarding the different approaches with an extensive validation based on event-related potentials (ERPs). More specifically, Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based methods were investigated. Their validation was not only performed with measures known from previous studies on the average ERPs, but most attention was focused on task-related measures, including their use on trial-to-trial information. These more detailed validation criteria enabled us to find a clearer distinction between the most widely used cleaning methods. Both OBS and ICA proved to be able to yield equally good results. However, ICA methods needed more parameter tuning, thereby making OBS more robust and easy to use. Moreover, applying OBS prior to ICA can optimize the data quality even more, but caution is recommended since the effect of the additional ICA step may be strongly subject-dependent.},

abstract={Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging-based motion and deformation tracking techniques combined with finite element (FE) analysis are a powerful method for soft tissue constitutive model parameter identification. However, deriving deformation data from MR images is complex and generally requires validation. In this paper a validation method is presented based on a silicone gel phantom containing contrasting spherical markers. Tracking of these markers provides a direct measure of deformation. Validation of in vivo medical imaging techniques is often challenging due to the lack of appropriate reference data and the validation method may lack an appropriate reference. This paper evaluates a validation method using simulated MR image data. This provided an appropriate reference and allowed different error sources to be studied independently and allowed evaluation of the method for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The geometric bias error was between 0-5.560×10-3 voxels while the noisy magnitude MR image simulations demonstrated errors under 0.1161 voxels (SNR: 5-35).},

abstract={Two grabens were developed in the Yi-Shu segment of the Tan-Lu fault zone (TLFZ) during its extensional activities, and are now confined by four major NNE-trending normal faults and filled with Cretaceous sediments. These faults were developed due to their reactivities, containing gouge and cutting the graben sediments. Detailed fieldwork demonstrates that the faults experienced sinistral transtensional moment related to regional NE-SW extension during the reactivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the finest gouge samples gives illite crystallinity values higher than 0.42°Δ2theta], indicating temperatures experienced by the gouge samples were less than 150°C. From the relation between K-Ar data and proportions of detrital illite in different size fractions of the gouge samples, we conclude that refaulting for the western boundary fault of the TLFZ, abbreviated to F4, took place at ca. 90 Ma and for the eastern boundary fault, abbreviated to F1, happened from 70 to 60 Ma. During the two phases of reactivity imposed by the same NE-SW extension, the TLFZ experienced uplifting and no sediments were deposited in the two grabens. It is suggested that the TLFZ experienced extension during the Late Cretaceous, which supports the inference that lithospheric thinning was still undergoing in the east of the North China Craton during the Late Cretaceous magmatic hiatus.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Robotic surgery is an accepted adjunct to minimally invasive surgery, but training is restricted to console time. Virtual-reality (VR) simulation has been shown to be effective for laparoscopic training and so we seek to validate a novel VR robotic simulator. The American Urological Association (AUA) Office of Education approved this study. Subjects enrolled in a robotics training course at the 2007 AUA annual meeting underwent skills training in a da Vinci dry-lab module and a virtual-reality robotics module which included a three-dimensional (3D) VR robotic simulator. Demographic and acceptability data were obtained, and performance metrics from the simulator were compared between experienced and nonexperienced roboticists for a ring transfer task. Fifteen subjects—four with previous robotic surgery experience and 11 without—participated. Nine subjects were still in urology training and nearly half of the group had reported playing video games. Overall performance of the da Vinci system and the simulator were deemed acceptable by a Likert scale (0–6) rating of 5.23 versus 4.69, respectively. Experienced subjects outperformed nonexperienced subjects on the simulator on three metrics: total task time (96 s versus 159 s, P < 0.02), economy of motion (1,301 mm versus 2,095 mm, P < 0.04), and time the telemanipulators spent outside of the center of the platform’s workspace (4 s versus 35 s, P < 0.02). This is the first demonstration of face and construct validity of a virtual-reality robotic simulator. Further studies assessing predictive validity are ultimately required to support incorporation of VR robotic simulation into training curricula.},

abstract={A comprehensive gene collection for S. oneidensis was constructed using the lambda recombinase (Gateway) cloning system. A total of 3584 individual ORFs (85%) have been successfully cloned into the entry plasmids. To validate the use of the clone set, three sets of ORFs were examined within three different destination vectors constructed in this study. Success rates for heterologous protein expression of S. oneidensis His- or His/GST- tagged proteins in E. coli were approximately 70%. The ArcA and NarP transcription factor proteins were tested in an in vitro binding assay to demonstrate that functional proteins can be successfully produced using the clone set. Further functional validation of the clone set was obtained from phage display experiments in which a phage encoding thioredoxin was successfully isolated from a pool of 80 different clones after three rounds of biopanning using immobilized anti-thioredoxin antibody as a target. This clone set complements existing genomic (e.g., whole-genome microarray) and other proteomic tools (e.g., mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis), and facilitates a wide variety of integrated studies, including protein expression, purification, and functional analyses of proteins both in vivo and in vitro.},

abstract={Testing Viscosity of MR Fluid in Magnetic Field The purpose of this paper was to determine the coefficient of viscosity of a magneto-rheological fluid for different values of the magnetic field and to determine parameters at which the flow of the fluid through a capillary is stopped. To determine the coefficient of viscosity, a method of indirect measurement was implemented using a reference fluid with the known properties. A test stand with a capillary viscometer was constructed. The measurements showed that the viscosity of the magneto-rheological fluid was linearly dependent in a wide range of values of the magnetic induction.},

abstract={An accurate autoregressive (AR) model can reflect the characteristics of a dynamic system based on which the fault feature of gear vibration signal can be extracted without constructing mathematical model and studying the fault mechanism of gear vibration system, which are experienced by the time-frequency analysis methods. However, AR model can only be applied to stationary signals, while the gear fault vibration signals usually present nonstationary characteristics. Therefore, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which can decompose the vibration signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), is introduced into feature extraction of gear vibration signals as a preprocessor before AR models are generated. On the other hand, by targeting the difficulties of obtaining sufficient fault samples in practice, support vector machine (SVM) is introduced into gear fault pattern recognition. In the proposed method in this paper, firstly, vibration signals are decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions, then the AR model of each IMF component is established; finally, the corresponding autoregressive parameters and the variance of remnant are regarded as the fault characteristic vectors and used as input parameters of SVM classifier to classify the working condition of gears. The experimental analysis results show that the proposed approach, in which IMF AR model and SVM are combined, can identify working condition of gears with a success rate of 100% even in the case of smaller number of samples.},

abstract={Objective: In the field of cardiac MR image segmentation, active contour models, or snakes have been extensively used, owing to their promising results and to the numerous extensions proposed to improve their performance. This paper explores a methodology for evaluating cardiac MR image segmentation algorithms, which assesses the distance between computer-generated and the observer's hand-outlined boundaries. This metric was applied to various external force extensions of the traditional snake, since no systematic comparison has been performed. Materials and methods: Cardiac MRI from six patients were analyzed. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T MR scanner with ECG-gated balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequences. Segmentation performances were established for traditional snake, gradient vector flow snake, standard- and guided- pressure force-based snake. The use of a pre-treatment with non-linear anisotropic filtering was also compared to non-filtered images. Results: Agreement between manual and segmentation algorithms was satisfactory for ejection fraction for every segmentation scheme. However end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were systematically underestimated. Conclusion: The developed regional error metric provided a more rigorous evaluation of the segmentation schemes in comparison to the classical derived parameters based on left ventricle volume estimation, usually used in functional cardiac MR studies. These derived parameters can furthermore mask local segmentation errors. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Simulated deformations and images can act as the gold standard for evaluating various template-based image segmentation and registration algorithms. Traditional deformable simulation methods, such as the use of analytic deformation fields or the displacement of landmarks followed by some form of interpolation, are often unable to construct rich (complex) and/or realistic deformations of anatomical organs. This paper presents new methods aiming to automatically simulate realistic inter- and intra-individual deformations. The paper first describes a statistical approach to capturing inter-individual variability of high-deformation fields from a number of examples (training samples). In this approach, Wavelet-Packet Transform (WPT) of the training deformations and their Jacobians, in conjunction with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial regularization, are used to capture both coarse and fine characteristics of the training deformations in a statistical fashion. Simulated deformations can then be constructed by randomly sampling the resultant statistical distribution in an unconstrained or a landmark-constrained fashion. The paper also describes a model for generating tissue atrophy or growth in order to simulate intra-individual brain deformations. Several sets of simulated deformation fields and respective images are generated, which can be used in the future for systematic and extensive validation studies of automated atlas-based segmentation and deformable registration methods. The code and simulated data are available through our Web site.},

abstract={As population-based epidemiologic studies may acquire images from thousands of subjects, automated image post-processing is needed. However, error in these methods may be biased and related to subject characteristics relevant to the research question. Here, we compare two automated methods of brain extraction against manually segmented images and evaluate whether method accuracy is associated with subject demographic and health characteristics. MRI data (n = 296) are from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, a population-based study of elderly Japanese-American men. The intracranial space was manually outlined on the axial proton density sequence by a single operator. The brain was extracted automatically using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) and BSE (Brain Surface Extractor) on axial proton density images. Total intracranial volume was calculated for the manually segmented images (ticvM), the BET segmented images (ticvBET) and the BSE segmented images (ticvBSE). Mean ticvBSE was closer to that of ticvM, but ticvBET was more highly correlated with ticvM than ticvBSE. BSE had significant over (positive error) and underestimated (negative error) ticv, but net error was relatively low. BET had large positive and very low negative error. Method accuracy, measured in percent positive and negative error, varied slightly with age, head circumference, presence of the apolipoprotein estraight epsilon]4 polymorphism, subcortical and cortical infracts and enlarged ventricles. This epidemiologic approach to the assessment of potential bias in image post-processing tasks shows both skull-stripping programs performed well in this large image dataset when compared to manually segmented images. Although method accuracy was statistically associated with some subject characteristics, the extent of the misclassification (in terms of percent of brain volume) was small.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo test whether basic skills acquired on a virtual endoscopic surgery simulator are transferable from virtual reality to physical reality in a comparable training setting.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATAFor surgical training in laparoscopic surgery, new training methods have to be developed that allow surgeons to first practice in a simulated setting before operating on real patients. A virtual endoscopic surgery trainer (VEST) has been developed within the framework of a joint project. Because of principal limitations of simulation techniques, it is essential to know whether training with this simulator is comparable to conventional training.METHODSDevices used were the VEST system and a conventional video trainer (CVT). Two basic training tasks were constructed identically (a) as virtual tasks and (b) as mechanical models for the CVT. Test persons were divided into 2 groups each consisting of 12 novices and 4 experts. Each group carried out a defined training program over the course of 4 consecutive days on the VEST or the CVT, respectively. To test the transfer of skills, the groups switched devices on the 5th day. The main parameter was task completion time.RESULTSThe novices in both groups showed similar learning curves. The mean task completion times decreased significantly over the 4 training days of the study. The task completion times for the control task on Day 5 were significantly lower than on Days 1 and 2. The experts' task completion times were much lower than those of the novices.CONCLUSIONSThis study showed that training with a computer simulator, just as with the CVT, resulted in a reproducible training effect. The control task showed that skills learned in virtual reality are transferable to the physical reality of a CVT. The fact that the experts showed little improvement demonstrates that the simulation trains surgeons in basic laparoscopic skills learned in years of practice.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo develop a software for virtual reality (VR) simulation of X-ray images based on perspective projections through a patient model derived from data from a CT examination and to evaluate the accuracy in the projection geometry obtained by the software.METHODSA VR software was developed on a personal computer, with models of a patient, an X-ray machine and a detector. The model of the patient was derived from data from a CT examination of a dry skull. Simulated radiographic images of the patient model could be rendered as perspective projections based on the relative positions between the models. The projection geometry of the software was validated by developing an artificial CT data set containing high attenuation points as objects to be imaged. The accuracy in projection geometry was evaluated in a systematic way. The distances between two dots, representing the projected test points in the simulated radiographic images, were measured. They were compared with theoretical calculations of the corresponding distances using traditional mathematical tools.RESULTSThe difference between the simulated and calculated projected distances never exceeded 0.5 mm. The error in simulated projected distances was in most cases within 1%. No systematic errors were revealed.CONCLUSIONThe software, developed for personal computers, can produce simulated X-ray images with high geometric accuracy based on perspective projections through a CT data set. The software can be used for simulation of radiographic examinations.},

abstract={Objective To determine whether the size of a perfusion defect seen at myocardial perfusion MR imaging represents the extent of irreversibly damaged myocardium in acute reperfused myocardial infarction. Materials and Methods In nine cats, reperfused myocardial infarction was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 90 minutes and subsequent reperfusion for 90 minutes. At single-slice myocardial perfusion MR imaging at the midventricular level using a turbo-FLASH sequence, 60 short-axis images were sequentially obtained with every heart beat after bolus injection of gadomer-17. The size of the perfusion defect was measured and compared with both the corresponding unstained area seen at triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and the hyperenhanced area seen at gadophrin-2-enhanced MR imaging performed in the same cat six hours after myocardial perfusion MR imaging. Results The sizes of perfusion defects seen at gadomer-17-enhanced perfusion MR imaging, unstained areas at TTC staining, and hyperenhanced areas at gadophrin-2-enhanced MR imaging were 20.4 ± 4.3%, 29.0 ± 9.7%, and 30.7 ± 10.6% of the left ventricular myocardium, respectively. The perfusion defects seen at myocardial perfusion MR imaging were significantly smaller than the unstained areas at TTC staining and hyperenhanced areas at gadophrin-2-enhanced MR imaging (pr = .64, p = .062 and r = .70, p = .035, respectively). Conclusion In this cat model, the perfusion defect revealed by myocardial perfusion MR imaging underestimated the true size of acute reperfused myocardial infarction. The defect may represent a more severely damaged area of infarction and probably has prognostic significance.},

The needles are guided by using fast gradient-recalled echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo images. Surgical navigation software provided T2-weighted images critical to targeting the peripheral zone and the tumor. MR imaging can be used to guide prostate biopsy.},

abstract={In canonical vector time series autoregressions, which permit dependence only on past values, the errors generally show contemporaneous correlation. By contrast structural vector autoregressions allow contemporaneous series dependence and assume errors with no contemporaneous correlation. Such models having a recursive structure can be described by a directed acyclic graph. We show, with the use of a real example, how the identification of these models may be assisted by examination of the conditional independence graph of contemporaneous and lagged variables. In this example we identify the causal dependence of monthly Italian bank loan interest rates on government bond and repurchase agreement rates. When the number of series is larger, the structural modelling of the canonical errors alone is a useful initial step, and we first present such an example to demonstrate the general approach to identifying a directed graphical model.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={AIMWe evaluated a Siemens software of flow quantification (FQ) by MR phase mapping, in the framework of a common practical use.METHODSExperiments with a laminar flow phantom and in vivo pulsatile flow were performed. In particular, FQ in ascending aorta was investigated in healthy volunteers.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONFlow phantom experiments reveal that the FQ slightly underestimates (8% on the average) actual velocities (mean velocities over a vessel area), and also that velocity uncertainties are related to the encoding velocity value, whatever the measured velocity. Furthermore, using well characterized working criteria, we found low intraobserver variability and negligible interobserver variability in ascending aorta FQs. The role played by the choice of reference area in FQ accuracy is emphasized. When recording several cardiac cycles during the same acquisition, it is shown that the FQ software may provide erroneous results. Several comments for FQ software use in the ascending aorta are added.},

abstract={An isothermal spectroscopic technique called time analyzed transient spectroscopy (TATS) in the constant capacitance (CC) mode has been used to characterize electrically active defects in the MeV Ar+ implanted silicon. The problems associated with high defect density and the presence of damaged region in the as-implanted material are overcome by CC-TATS method. The CC-TATS spectra of the as-implanted sample shows two positive peaks and an attendant negative peak. Two distinct traps have also been identified using thermally stimulated capacitance method modified to operate in constant capacitance mode. Variable pulse width measurements using CC-TATS show exponential capture kinetics in contrast to extremely slow capture observed in conventional deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) experiment. The results indicate that trapping behaviour is due to point-like defects associated with extended defects such as dislocation and stacking fault.},

abstract={En el presente trabajo examinamos dos procedimientos de análisis apropiados a un diseño experimental aleatorio con varias medidas consecutivas a lo largo del tiempo para cada una de las unidades experimentales. Un enfoque para el análisis de tales datos consiste en aplicar el tradicional modelo mixto del AVAR con la estructura del error modelada a través de procesos ARMA. Alternativamente, el problema también puede ser considerado desde una perspectiva más general haciendo uso del enfoque multivariado de medidas repetidas. Datos simulados mediante procedimientos de Monte Carlo son empleados para investigar el efecto que el incumplimiento de las asunciones subyacentes a los modelos tiene sobre el grado de sesgadez de los parámetros estimados, sobre la probabilidad empírica de cometer errores Tipo I y sobre la potencia de prueba de los test estadísticos para cada uno de los dos procedimientos.Alternate abstract: Comparison of the power and robustness of AMVAR of repeated measures versus the correspondent mixed model of AVAR with the error including serial dependence. In this research two procedures of analysis for a random experimental desing with several consecutive measures for each experimental unit are analized and composed. To analize this kind of data a traditional mixed model of AVAR with the error structure modeled through ARMA processes can be used. The problem can be worked out as well from a more general perspective, using a multivariate repeated measures approach. Both approaches are compared using simulated data obtaining with Monte Carlo procedures. Special attention was paid to a) the robustness of model parameter estimates when some assumptions are violated, b) the power of statistical test for both procedures.},
