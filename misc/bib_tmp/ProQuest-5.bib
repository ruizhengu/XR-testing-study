abstract={Nonequilibrium plasmas have been extensively investigated for polymer surface treatments in industrial applications. Plasma treatments can change the properties, such as electrical, chemical, tribological, biological, optical, and mechanical, which are easy to scale up to industrial applications. These can be extended to electronic industry. Consequently, light-emitting diode (LED) package was processed using Ar plasma at various flow rates and times. Thermal transient analysis showed reduced total thermal resistance (Formula Omitted]) and reduced rise in junction temperature (Formula Omitted]) for Ar plasma processed LED compared to the bare LED package data. Among the process parameters considered, 20-sccm flow of Ar gas exhibited better performance with respect to processing times. A noticeable reduction in Formula Omitted] value was recorded (Formula Omitted]) for Ar plasma processed LED from that of bare LED. Surface modification through cross linking was assumed by the Ar plasma process and supported to enhance the heat transfer through the modified surface of silicone encapsulation of the LED. In addition, the surface smoothness of silicone was induced by Ar plasma and helped to exhibit efficient heat transfer via convection. Based on the observed results, the Ar plasma process would be an effective postprocessing method for LED package to improve the performance as well as lifetime.},

abstract={The graded exercise stress test (GEST) is used by the Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) to evaluate patient heart health and prescribe rehabilitative exercise. Understanding, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating the different pathological cardiac conditions during the GEST is important for exercise treatment. GEST training and assessments are typically conducted through live simulation experiences making it difficult to simulate actual high-risk clinical cases. Virtual reality (VR) provides a means of delivering reliable and immersive simulated experiences that can engage and enhance student learning. Ten AEPs were interviewed to identify current barriers to GEST training and assessment provision. Barriers were presented to a cohort of five experienced VR software developers who suggested VR platforms could work to effectively alleviate identified barriers. The findings indicate that the traditional GEST training model provides a solid foundation of understanding. However, there are limitations such as ensuring that the students experience all aspects of the task as well as the work with high acuity patients.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDAccurately measuring postural sway is an important part of balance assessment and rehabilitation. Although force plates give accurate measurements, their costs and space requirements make their use impractical in many situations.OBJECTIVEThe work presented in this paper aimed to address this issue by validating a virtual reality (VR) headset as a relatively low-cost alternative to force plates for postural sway measurement. The HTC Vive (HTC Corporation) VR headset has built-in sensors that allow for position and orientation tracking, making it a potentially eﬀective tool for balance assessments.METHODSParticipants in this study were asked to stand upright on a force plate (NeuroCom; Natus Medical Incorporated) while wearing the HTC Vive. Position data were collected from the headset and force plate simultaneously as participants experienced a custom-built VR environment that covered their entire field of view. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to examine the test-retest reliability of the postural control variables, which included the normalized path length, root mean square (RMS), and peak-to-peak (P2P) value. These were computed from the VR position output data and the center of pressure (COP) data from the force plate. Linear regression was used to investigate the correlations between the VR and force plate measurements.RESULTSOur results showed that the test-retest reliability of the RMS and P2P value of VR headset outputs (ICC: range 0.285-0.636) was similar to that of the RMS and P2P value of COP outputs (ICC: range 0.228-0.759). The linear regression between VR and COP measures showed significant correlations in RMSs and P2P values.CONCLUSIONSBased on our results, the VR headset has the potential to be used for postural control measurements. However, the further development of software and testing protocols for balance assessments is needed.},

abstract={Prior laboratory experiments among healthy samples found that training avoidance movements to angry faces may lower anger and aggression, especially people high in trait anger. To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, the present researchers developed it into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). The current study examined the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 30). In addition to the aggression replacement training, patients played either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Aggressive behavior was measured pre-, half-way, and post-treatment via self-report and clinicians ratings. No difference was found between the VR-GAIME and the control game. However, the participants reported gaining more insight into their own behavior and that of others. Future VR intervention tools in clinical settings may capitalize more on their benefits for self-reflection within interpersonal settings.},

abstract={Background A key clinical issue is how to maximise the belief change central to cognitive therapy. Physiological arousal is a key internal cue confirming threat beliefs in anxiety disorders. Deeper extinction of anxiety may occur if catastrophizing responses to physiological arousal are inhibited prior to joint exposure with external phobic stimuli. The aim of the study was to test whether increasing physiological arousal using exercise increases the benefits of behavioural tests. Methods Sixty individuals with a fear of heights had one session of VR cognitive treatment. They were randomised to have the treatment either with periods of intense physical exercise (cycling at 80% of maximum heart rate) prior to exposures or without. Linear mixed effects models were used to check the manipulation and test the primary hypothesis of a group difference in degree of conviction in the phobic threat belief. Results Heart rate was significantly higher in the exercise group throughout compared with the control group. Both groups showed significant reductions in threat beliefs after the VR treatment (d = 1.0, p < 0.001) but there was no significant group difference (d = 0.1, p = 0.56). Discussion An increase in physiological arousal achieved via exercise did not enhance cognitive change in beliefs about feared stimuli.},

abstract={As post‐secondary education migrates online, developing and evaluating new avenues for assessment in anatomy is paramount. Three‐dimensional (3D) visualization technology is one area with the potential to augment or even replace resource‐intensive cadaver use in anatomical education. This manuscript details the development of a smartphone application, entitled “Virtual Reality Bell‐Ringer (VRBR),” capable of displaying monoscopic two‐dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic 3D images with the use of an inexpensive cardboard headset for use in spot examinations. Cadaveric image use, creation, and pinning processes are explained, and the source code is provided. To validate this tool, this paper compares traditional laboratory‐based spot examination assessment stations against those administered using the VRBR application to test anatomical knowledge. Participants (undergraduate, n = 38; graduate, n = 13) completed three spot examinations specific to their level of study, one in each of the modalities (2D, 3D, laboratory) as well as a mental rotation test (MRT), Stereo Fly stereotest, and cybersickness survey. Repeated measures ANCOVA suggested participants performed significantly better on laboratory and 3D stations compared to 2D stations. Moderate to severe cybersickness symptoms were reported by 63% of participants in at least one category while using the VRBR application. Highest reported symptoms included: eye strain, general discomfort, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating. Overall, the VRBR application is a promising tool for its portability, affordability, and accessibility. Due to reported cybersickness and other technical limitations, the use of VRBR as an alternative to cadaveric specimens presents several challenges when testing anatomy knowledge that must be addressed before widespread adoption.},

abstract={Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.},

abstract={The Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) and Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) optimization techniques are used to optimize the parameters of shear mode magneto-rheological (MR) damper design to achieve the defined objectives. The purpose is to develop a smart damper for washing machine application. The main objective is to optimize parameters like magnetic coil height, width, radius of piston road and optimum fluid volume (as this contributes to 60% cost of MR damper). The anisotropic-particle-based MR fluid (having high stress at low magnetic field strength) properties are used in optimization. GRG and GRA gave similar results for the optimized parameter values. GRA method gives additional advantages in design validation. ANOVA Minitab software is used to analyse significant contributions of each parameter in the design part. The practical shear mode MR damper was fabricated using optimized design parameters. The force–displacement curve was recorded using the damper test rig. The obtained force values at each magnetic field strength agree well with the calculated ones. The fluid volume used was 1.5 ml, and power and force values were, respectively, 5 W and 55 N. The reduced volume of MR fluid and power will help in commercializing this damper for washing machines.},

abstract={Background: Although prior research has established that freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with anxiety, only one study to date has directly manipulated anxiety levels to induce FOG. Objective: The current study aimed to replicate these previous findings and evaluate whether a seated version of a ‘threat’ virtual reality (VR) paradigm could induce anxiety and provoke FOG. Methods: Twenty-four PD patients with FOG were assessed across various threat conditions in both a walking VR paradigm (Experiment 1) and a seated VR paradigm (Experiment 2). Both paradigms manipulated the height (i.e., elevated vs ground) and width (wide vs narrow) of the planks participants were instructed to walk across. Results: Across both experiments, the Elevated + Narrow condition provoked significantly greater number of freezing episodes compared to all other conditions. Higher levels of self-reported anxiety were reported during the Elevated+Narrow condition compared to all other conditions in Experiment 1, and compared to the Ground condition in Experiment 2. Conclusion: These findings confirm that anxiety contributes to FOG and validates the use of a seated VR threat paradigm for provoking anxiety-related freezing. This enables future studies to combine this paradigm with functional MRI to explore the neural correlates underlying the role of anxiety in FOG.},

abstract={New technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking software have paved the way for more sophisticated and ecologically valid measures of cognitive function. Testing the sensitivity and reliability of such measurements in response to acute alcohol intoxication provides a first step in establishing how these measures may operate in relation to cognitive impairments observed post-concussion. Healthy young adults (N = 54, M = 20.65, SD = 2.06, 30 females) completed the CONVIRT test battery (manual simple and choice reaction-time and saccade reaction-time) at three breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels: 0.00%T1, 0.05%T2, 0.08%T3. Participants consumed alcoholic beverages at 30-min intervals, with BrAC monitored at 15-min intervals using a breathalyser. All three CONVIRT measures were sensitive to changes in cognitive performance induced by alcohol at BrAC levels at or exceeding 0.05%. A composite measure was also sensitive to alcohol intoxication (Cohen’s d = .85 at BrAC = 0.05%; d = 1.20 at BrAC = 0.08%). Strong test–retest reliability was observed (all r < .80), with no gender differences noted. CONVIRT measures were reliable and detected dose-dependent changes in alcohol-induced cognitive impairment. Potentially, the ecologically valid measures may assist in better quantifying the effects of conditions such as concussion, on cognitive performance.},

abstract={As post-secondary education migrates online, developing and evaluating new avenues for assessment in anatomy is paramount. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology is one area with the potential to augment or even replace resource-intensive cadaver use in anatomical education. This manuscript details the development of a smartphone application, entitled "Virtual Reality Bell-Ringer (VRBR)," capable of displaying monoscopic two-dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic 3D images with the use of an inexpensive cardboard headset for use in spot examinations. Cadaveric image use, creation, and pinning processes are explained, and the source code is provided. To validate this tool, this paper compares traditional laboratory-based spot examination assessment stations against those administered using the VRBR application to test anatomical knowledge. Participants (undergraduate, n = 38; graduate, n = 13) completed three spot examinations specific to their level of study, one in each of the modalities (2D, 3D, laboratory) as well as a mental rotation test (MRT), Stereo Fly stereotest, and cybersickness survey. Repeated measures ANCOVA suggested participants performed significantly better on laboratory and 3D stations compared to 2D stations. Moderate to severe cybersickness symptoms were reported by 63% of participants in at least one category while using the VRBR application. Highest reported symptoms included: eye strain, general discomfort, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating. Overall, the VRBR application is a promising tool for its portability, affordability, and accessibility. Due to reported cybersickness and other technical limitations, the use of VRBR as an alternative to cadaveric specimens presents several challenges when testing anatomy knowledge that must be addressed before widespread adoption.},

abstract={A common operation performed in Virtual Reality (VR) environments is locomotion. Although real walking can represent a natural and intuitive way to manage displacements in such environments, its use is generally limited by the size of the area tracked by the VR system (typically, the size of a room) or requires expensive technologies to cover particularly extended settings. A number of approaches have been proposed to enable effective explorations in VR, each characterized by different hardware requirements and costs, and capable to provide different levels of usability and performance. However, the lack of a well-defined methodology for assessing and comparing available approaches makes it difficult to identify, among the various alternatives, the best solutions for selected application domains. To deal with this issue, this article introduces a novel evaluation testbed which, by building on the outcomes of many separate works reported in the literature, aims to support a comprehensive analysis of the considered design space. An experimental protocol for collecting objective and subjective measures is proposed, together with a scoring system able to rank locomotion approaches based on a weighted set of requirements. Testbed usage is illustrated in a use case requesting to select the technique to adopt in a given application scenario.},

abstract={Mirror therapy (MT) has been proposed as an essential component of upper limb neuro-rehabilitation, using mirror illusion of the unaffected hand movement and superimposing it on the affected hand to improve neuroplasticity for improving motor recovery in stroke patients. In this paper, we developed a virtual reality mirror therapy (VRMT) system, and examined the performance of the proposed VRMT system. The VRMT system consists of a motion-tracking device, a VR goggle, and a VRMT software. Young, healthy participants, and stroke patients with mild-to-severe hemiparesis were recruited in this study, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed VRMT system. Experimental results based on the pinch-holding-up activity (PHUA) test revealed a significant effect on the precision pinch performance of young-healthy participants receiving VRMT, whereas traditional MT could not improve the precision pinch performance in young-healthy participants (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted]). For patients having suffered a stroke and being treated with VRMT, significant beneficial effects examined by mixed effect model were found on the total score of FMA (Formula Omitted]) and hand part of FMA (Formula Omitted]). The findings in this study indicate that the VRMT system has a potentially positive effects on the sensorimotor performance of hands in healthy participants. In addition, add-on effect of VR to MT provides beneficial effects on motor function of the upper extremity in chronic stroke patients.},

abstract={The development of multiple cultural and social related activities, such as shows related with the performing arts, conferences or presentations rely on facilities such as auditoriums, theatres and conference sites, which are progressively including multiple technological features in order to enhance user experience. There are still however situations in which user experience is limited owing to lack of environment adaption, such as people with disabilities. In this sense, the adoption of Context Aware paradigms within auditoriums can provide adequate functionalities in order to comply with specific needs. This work is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility in enhancing user experience (e.g., improving the autonomy of disabled people) within auditorium and theatre environments, by means of an Augmented Reality (AR) device (HoloLens smart glasses) with wireless system integration. To carry out the demonstration, different elements to build AR applications are described and tested. First, an intensive measurement campaign was performed in a real auditorium in the city of Pamplona (Baluarte Congress Center) in order to evaluate the feasibility of using Wi-Fi enabled AR devices in a complex wireless propagation scenario. The results show that these environments exhibit high levels of interference, owing to the co-existence and non-coordinated operation of multiple wireless communication systems, such as on site and temporary Wi-Fi access points, wireless microphones or communications systems used by performers, staff and users. Deterministic wireless channel estimation based in volumetric 3D Ray Launching have been obtained for the complete scenario volume, in order to assess quality of service metrics. For illustration purposes, a user-friendly application to help hearing impaired people was developed and its main features were tested in the auditorium. Such an application provides users with a 3D virtual space to visualize useful multimedia content like subtitles or additional information about the show, as well as an integrated call button.},

abstract={As the global population ages, the incidence of major neurocognitive disorders (major NCDs), such as the most common geriatric major NCD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), has grown. Thus, the need for more definitive cognitive assessment or even effective non-pharmacological intervention for age-related NCDs is becoming more and more pressing given that no definitive diagnostics or efficacious therapeutics are currently unavailable for them. We evaluate the current state of the art of cognitive assessment for major NCDs, and then briefly glance ahead at potential application of virtual reality (VR) technologies in major NCD assessment and in cognition training of visuospatial reasoning in a 3D environment, as well as in the alleviation of depression and other symptoms of cognitive disorders. We believe that VR-based technologies have tremendous potentials in cognitive assessment and non-pharmacological therapy for major NCDs.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) allows for the creation of ecological environments that could be used for cognitive assessment and intervention. This study comprises two parts that describe and assess an immersive VR task, the Virtual Shop, which can be used to measure episodic memory. Part 1 addresses its applicability in healthy older adults by measuring presence, motivation, and cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task, and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in the Virtual Shop, in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence, higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task, and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups, and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus, the use of VR is feasible in older adults and the Virtual Shop is a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.},

abstract={The psychological effects of information technology (IT) use have been widely reported and assessed in the literature. However, although concerns are growing regarding the potential physiological impacts of IT use on the health of IT users, assessment of this issue is currently hampered by the lack of an appropriate information-system (IS) physiological scale. Given the limited utility of existing self-report instruments, the main purpose of this study is to develop an instrument to measure perceived physiological vulnerability to IT use (PPVITU). This study introduces and defines a PPVITU construct, validates this construct and its basic dimensions empirically, develops a generic PPVITU instrument with appropriate psychometric properties, and examines the theoretical and practical applications of this instrument. After analyzing data provided by 308 IT-user respondents, this study proposes a 4-factor, 17-item PPVITU instrument. The authors expect that this empirically validated instrument will be useful to researchers working to develop and test theories of educational technology use as well as to educators working to better understand student perceptions of physiological vulnerability to IT and educational-technology use.},

abstract={With more readily available commercial immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies, the potential of new feedback strategies as tools to facilitate motor rehabilitation should be investigated. Augmented feedback or error augmentation (EA) can easily be shown in a virtual environment. Here, visual EA provided via immersive VR was tested for its effectiveness to improve bimanual symmetry in a reaching task. A single-session crossover design was used to test two training cases, with or without EA. With EA, the distance between hands in the forward direction was augmented. Participants were recruited from typically developing (TD) populations (n = 12, ages 13–21) and performed in an adapted environment with an initial asymmetry between limbs. Also, five participants with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) (ages 14–21, MACS I-III) completed the study. Among TD participants, a significantly larger change in symmetry in the adapted environment was shown after EA than training without EA (F (1, 10) = 9.64, p = 0.01). Each participant in the CP group also improved more after EA training (8.8–103.7)%, such that they achieved lower symmetry error after training with EA. As participants in both groups adapted more symmetrically with EA, beneficial changes from this training method could be evaluated in future studies for longer-term functional changes.},

abstract={Background: Prior laboratory findings indicate that training avoidance movements to angry faces may lower anger and aggression among healthy participants, especially those high in trait anger. To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, it has been developed into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). Methods: The proposed study will examine the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 60). In addition to the aggression replacement training, participants will play either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Anger will be assessed using self-report. Aggressive impulses will be measured via self-report, a validated laboratory paradigm, and rated by clinicians. Discussion: The authors hypothesize that the combination of the VR-GAIME and regular aggression treatment will be more successful in reducing aggressive behavior. One of the strengths of the proposed study is that it is the first to examine the effects of a motivational intervention in a clinical sample characterized by problems in regulating anger and aggression. Another strength of the proposed study is that the VR-GAIME will be implemented as a multi-session intervention. Additionally, the VR-GAIME applies, for the first time, serious gaming and virtual reality on an avoidance motivation intervention. If positive results are found, the VR-GAIME may be systematically deployed in forensic psychiatric settings. Trial registration: The trial is registered with The Netherlands National Trial Register, number: NTR6986.},

abstract={For successful fitness coaching in virtual reality, movements of a trainee must be analyzed in order to provide feedback. To date, most coaching systems only provide coarse information on movement quality. We propose a novel pipeline to detect a trainee’s errors during exercise that is designed to automatically generate feedback for the trainee. Our pipeline consists of an online temporal warp of a trainee’s motion, followed by Random-Forest-based feature selection. The selected features are used for the classification performed by Support Vector Machines. Our feedback to the trainee can consist of predefined verbal information as well as automatically generated visual augmentations. For the latter, we exploit information on feature importance to generate real-time feedback in terms of augmented color highlights on the trainee’s avatar. We show our pipeline’s superiority over two popular approaches from human activity recognition applied to our problem, k-Nearest Neighbor, combined with Dynamic Time Warping (KNN-DTW), as well as a recent combination of Convolutional Neural Networks with a Long Short-term Memory Network. We compare classification quality, time needed for classification, as well as the classifiers’ ability to automatically generate augmented feedback. In an exemplary application, we demonstrate that our pipeline is suitable to deliver verbal as well as automatically generated augmented feedback inside a CAVE-based sports training environment in virtual reality.},

abstract={Eating is a multimodal experience. When we eat, we perceive not just the taste and aroma of foods, but also their visual, auditory, and tactile properties, as well as sensory input from our surroundings. Foods are commonly tested within a sensory booth, designed specifically to limit such input. Foods are not commonly experienced in such isolation, but alongside this context, which can alter how a food is perceived. In this study, we show that the sensory properties of food can be altered by changing the environment it is consumed in, using virtual reality (VR) to provide an immersive, dynamic context to the eating experience. The purpose of this project was to develop an affordable and easy‐to‐implement methodology for adapting VR technology to sensory evaluation, without prohibitive amounts of expensive equipment or specialized programming knowledge. Virtual environments were formed by processing custom‐recorded 360 degree videos and overlaying audio, text, sensory scales, and images to simulate a typical sensory evaluation ballot within the VR headset. In a pilot test, participants were asked to taste 3 identical blue cheese samples in 3 virtual contexts–a sensory booth, a park bench, and a cow barn. Respondents rated their liking of the sample, as well as its saltiness, and pungency, attributes either reflective of one context (pungency in the barn), or presumably unrelated (saltiness). Panelists duly rated the sample's flavor as being more pungent when consumed in the barn context. These results provide proof of concept for VR in applied sensory studies, providing an immersive context to a sensory test while remaining in place. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We consume foods in environments that can “spill over” into our perceptions of the food. Thus, we consider some foods “unsuitable” for certain settings, with others deemed more suitable for this locale. This has been studied for many years as sensory “context,” with written descriptions, pictures, or videos of such contexts. We present a method generating virtual reality contexts without any specist programming knowledge, for a few hundred dollars. In an accompanying pilot test, perception of a sample was significantly influenced by the VR context in which it was delivered.},

abstract={PurposeTo develop and validate a smartphone based Virtual Reality Epley Maneuver System (VREMS) for home use.MethodsA smartphone application was designed to produce stereoscopic views of a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, which when viewed after placing a smartphone in a virtual reality headset, allowed the user to be guided step-by-step through the Epley maneuver in a VR environment. Twenty healthy participants were recruited and randomized to undergo either assisted Epleys or self-administered Epleys following reading instructions from an Instructional Handout (IH). All participants were filmed and two expert Otologists reviewed the videos, assigning each participant a score (out of 10) for performance on each step. Participants rated their perceived workload by completing a validated task-load questionnaire (NASA Task Load Index) and averages for both groups were calculated.ResultsTwenty participants were evaluated with average age 26.4±7.12years old in the VREMS group and 26.1±7.72 in the IH group. The VR assisted group achieved an average score of 7.78±0.99 compared to 6.65±1.72 in the IH group. This result was statistically significant with p=0.0001 and side dominance did not appear to play a factor. Analyzing each step of the Epley maneuver demonstrated that assisted Epleys were done more accurately with statically significant results in steps 2–4. Results of the NASA-TLX scores were variable with no significant findings.ConclusionWe have developed and demonstrated face validity for VREMS through our randomized controlled trial. The VREMS platform is promising technology, which may improve the accuracy and effectiveness of home Epley treatments.Level of evidenceN/A.},

abstract={The relationship between obesity and hepatic steatosis is well known, and there are many methods to measure obesity and severity of hepatic steatosis. Because of advances in radiologic techniques, the areas of certain body components can be measured on computed tomography (CT) while the severity of hepatic steatosis can be measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with high accuracy. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between degree of fatty infiltration of the liver measured by MRS and body composition measured from CT images.We evaluated 95 potential liver donors who underwent abdomen CT and liver MRI (including MRS) between February 2014 and September 2015 in a tertiary university hospital. Body composition analysis was performed on CT images using commercial software. The areas of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and abdominal circumference were measured automatically and the area of muscle was measured semi-automatically. The degree of hepatic steatosis was measured by MRS.The degree of hepatic steatosis showed a significant correlation with total fat area, visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, muscle area, abdominal circumference, BMI, and ratio of visceral fat to total fat. The strongest correlation was between hepatic steatosis and the area of visceral fat in all subjects (r=0.569). Multivariate regression analysis showed that male gender and visceral fat area were significantly associated with hepatic steatosis (P = 0.031, <0.001, respectively).The area of visceral fat has the most intimate correlation to the severity of hepatic steatosis among all significantly correlated parameters associated with body habitus. Accurate and quantitative body composition measurement and degree of hepatic steatosis can be noninvasively performed using advanced radiological techniques.},

abstract={We examine the influence of street scales (the street width, building height, and street-width-to-building-height ratio, referred to as `width-to-height ratio' in the paper) on visual, acoustic, and audio-visual comfort evaluation (as evaluated by a set of participants) in urban areas. In addition, we examine the relationships between the sound level and the abovementioned subjective comfort evaluation except the visual one. After measuring the street scales and recording the street visual information with a 3D camcorder, the virtual 3D models of the streets were generated. Meanwhile, dual-channel acoustic signals of the streets were collected. Subsequently, subjective tests were carried out using a 3D virtual reality with corresponding sounds using 164 participants. The analysis shows that subjective attitudes are directly related to the street scales. In particular, there is a strong positive correlation between audio-visual comfort and the street width-to-height ratio. In contrast, the three indicators (visual, acoustic, and audio-visual comfort) are strongly negatively correlated to the height, and this type of negative correlation is also observed between subjective indicators (except the visual one) and the sound level. Overall, the respondents found the audio-visual level most comfortable when the street width-to-height ratio is greater than 1, street width is within 20 m, height of street buildings is less than 26 m, and the sound level is less than 58 dBA. It is expected that these findings can aid designers in predicting the ideal audio-visual environment quality for urban streets.},

abstract={Different rendering styles induce different levels of agency and user behaviors in virtual reality environments. We applied an electroencephalogram-based approach to investigate how the rendering style of the users' hands affects behavioral and cognitive responses. To this end, we introduced prediction errors due to cognitive conflicts during a 3-D object selection task by manipulating the selection distance of the target object. The results showed that, for participants with high behavioral inhibition scores, the amplitude of the negative event-related potential at approximately 50-250 ms correlated with the realism of the virtual hands. Concurring with the uncanny valley theory, these findings suggest that the more realistic the representation of the user's hand is, the more sensitive the user becomes toward subtle errors, such as tracking inaccuracies.},

abstract={Multimodal interactivity when supported in a foot reflexology virtual reality environment has the potential to relieve stress. Current works leading to the development of such an environment have focused on creating models involving human to human (H-to-H) interactions which later could be used as design requirements. The goal is to translate these requirements and lay foundation for the future foot reflexology virtual reality stress therapy (VRST) application. Despite the intention, the development missed an important activity that is feedback from those experts in the domain. This paper closes the gap by presenting an expert review to the multimodal H-to-H interaction model as a form of validation. Eight experts from the human computer interaction (HCI) domain or related field reviewed and provided feedback on the model. The reviews were utilised to reconstruct the multimodal H-to-H interaction model, consequently yielding a final validated model for foot reflexology VRST application.},

note={Copyright - © 2017 Author(s). Published by AIP Publishing; Last updated - 2024-03-06},
abstract={Haptic display units have been widely used for conveying button sensations to users, primarily employing vibrotactile actuators. However, the human feeling for pressing buttons mainly relies on kinaesthetic sensations (rather than vibrotactile sensations), and little studies exist on small-scale kinaesthetic haptic units. Thus, the primary goals of this paper are to design a miniature kinaesthetic actuator based on Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid that can convey various button-clicking sensations and to experimentally evaluate its haptic performance. The design focuses of the proposed actuator were to produce sufficiently large actuation forces (resistive forces) for human users in a given size constraint and to offer a wide range of actuation forces for conveying vivid haptic sensations to users. To this end, this study first performed a series of parametric studies using mathematical force models for multiple operating modes of MR fluid in conjunction with finite element electromagnetism analysis. After selecting design parameters based on parametric studies, a prototype actuator was constructed, and its performance was evaluated using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. It measured the actuator’s resistive force with a varying stroke (pressed depth) up to 1 mm and a varying input current from 0 A to 200 mA. The results show that the proposed actuator creates a wide range of resistive forces from around 2 N (off-state) to over 9.5 N at 200 mA. In order to assess the prototype’s performance in the terms of the haptic application prospective, a maximum force rate was calculated to determine just noticeable difference in force changes for the 1 mm stoke of the actuator. The results show that the force rate is sufficient to mimic various levels of button sensations, indicating that the proposed kinaesthetic actuator can offer a wide range of resistive force changes that can be conveyed to human operators.},

abstract={To assess the construct and face validity of ArthroS, a passive haptic VR simulator. A secondary aim was to evaluate the novel performance metrics produced by this simulator. Two groups of 30 participants, each divided into novice, intermediate or expert based on arthroscopic experience, completed three separate tasks on either the knee or shoulder module of the simulator. Performance was recorded using 12 automatically generated performance metrics and video footage of the arthroscopic procedures. The videos were blindly assessed using a validated global rating scale (GRS). Participants completed a survey about the simulator's realism and training utility. This new simulator demonstrated construct validity of its tasks when evaluated against a GRS (p less than or equal to 0.003 in all cases). Regarding it's automatically generated performance metrics, established outputs such as time taken (p less than or equal to 0.001) and instrument path length (p less than or equal to 0.007) also demonstrated good construct validity. However, two-thirds of the proposed 'novel metrics' the simulator reports could not distinguish participants based on arthroscopic experience. Face validity assessment rated the simulator as a realistic and useful tool for trainees, but the passive haptic feedback (a key feature of this simulator) is rated as less realistic. The ArthroS simulator has good task construct validity based on established objective outputs, but some of the novel performance metrics could not distinguish between surgical experience. The passive haptic feedback of the simulator also needs improvement. If simulators could offer automated and validated performance feedback, this would facilitate improvements in the delivery of training by allowing trainees to practise and self-assess.},

Use of virtual reality could facilitate new learning. Aims To test the hypothesis that enabling patients to test the threat predictions of persecutory delusions in virtual reality social environments with the dropping of safety-seeking behaviours (virtual reality cognitive therapy) would lead to greater delusion reduction than exposure alone (virtual reality exposure). Method Conviction in delusions and distress in a real-world situation were assessed in 30 patients with persecutory delusions. Patients were then randomised to virtual reality cognitive therapy or virtual reality exposure, both with 30 min in graded virtual reality social environments. Delusion conviction and real-world distress were then reassessed. Results In comparison with exposure, virtual reality cognitive therapy led to large reductions in delusional conviction (reduction 22.0%, P= 0.024, Cohen's d= 1.3) and real-world distress (reduction 19.6%, P= 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.8).

abstract={Stereopsis is the rich impression of three-dimensionality, based on binocular disparity-the differences between the two retinal images of the same world. However, a substantial proportion of the population is stereo-deficient, and relies mostly on monocular cues to judge the relative depth or distance of objects in the environment. Here we trained adults who were stereo blind or stereo-deficient owing to strabismus and/or amblyopia in a natural visuomotor task-a 'bug squashing' game-in a virtual reality environment. The subjects' task was to squash a virtual dichoptic bug on a slanted surface, by hitting it with a physical cylinder they held in their hand. The perceived surface slant was determined by monocular texture and stereoscopic cues, with these cues being either consistent or in conflict, allowing us to track the relative weighting of monocular versus stereoscopic cues as training in the task progressed. Following training most participants showed greater reliance on stereoscopic cues, reduced suppression and improved stereoacuity. Importantly, the training-induced changes in relative stereo weights were significant predictors of the improvements in stereoacuity. We conclude that some adults deprived of normal binocular vision and insensitive to the disparity information can, with appropriate experience, recover access to more reliable stereoscopic information.This article is part of the themed issue 'Vision in our three-dimensional world'.},

XRD indicated single phase nature of the films. Absence of impurity phase has been confirmed from several other measurements also. Ion implantation induces a large concentration of point defects into the films as identified from optical study. All films exhibit intrinsic FM at room temperature (RT). The magnetization attains the maximum for the film implanted with fluence 10 super(16) ions/cm super(2) with saturation magnetization (M sub(S)) value 0.69 emu/gm at RT. Magnetic properties of the films were interpreted using bound magnetic polaron (BMP). BMP generated from the intrinsic exchange interaction of Mn super(2+) ions and V sub(Zn) related defects actually controls the FM.

abstract={Brain monitoring of errors in one's own and other's actions is crucial for a variety of processes, ranging from the fine-tuning of motor skill learning to important social functions, such as reading out and anticipating the intentions of others. Here, we combined immersive virtual reality and EEG recording to explore whether embodying the errors of an avatar by seeing it from a first-person perspective may activate the error monitoring system in the brain of an onlooker. We asked healthy participants to observe, from a first- or third-person perspective, an avatar performing a correct or an incorrect reach-to-grasp movement toward one of two virtual mugs placed on a table. At the end of each trial, participants reported verbally how much they embodied the avatar's arm. Ratings were maximal in first-person perspective, indicating that immersive virtual reality can be a powerful tool to induce embodiment of an artificial agent, even through mere visual perception and in the absence of any cross-modal boosting. Observation of erroneous grasping from a first-person perspective enhanced error-related negativity and medial-frontal theta power in the trials where human onlookers embodied the virtual character, hinting at the tight link between early, automatic coding of error detection and sense of embodiment. Error positivity was similar in 1PP and 3PP, suggesting that conscious coding of errors is similar for self and other. Thus, embodiment plays an important role in activating specific components of the action monitoring system when others' errors are coded as if they are one's own errors.},

note={Date revised - 2016-03-01; Last updated - 2016-03-04},
abstract={When exposed to visual perturbations, the motor system rapidly learns to reduce errors through adaptation of future motor commands. However, in cerebellar and stroke patients with proprioceptive impairments, motor adaptation rates are significantly slower. A recent study suggests that adaptation rates may be modulated by the stability of perturbations and the history of errors. We hypothesize that reducing the visual magnitude of directional error in a reaching task should increase the speed of motor adaptation to a perturbation. We developed a method for the modulation of error magnitudes in virtual reality (VR), and we conducted two experiments exploring its effects on adaptation. 34 healthy subjects used a chair-mounted arm support to perform reaching movements towards a target while learning to compensate for visuomotor rotations. We observed that diminishing the visually perceived variability of visual directional error through VR accelerates adaptation. This effect showed persistence into trials when virtual error reduction was no longer present confirming the modulatory role of error memory. These findings support the hypothesis that the brain may keep a history of recent errors and differentially adjusts learning rates relative to the frequency of occurrence of errors. We predict that exposure to a distribution of visual motor errors with low variability and centered around task-relevant error values accelerates motor adaptation in patients with cerebellar degeneration.},

abstract={Designing a usable learning application is one of the key factors in ensuring effective learning. This article introduces modified group usability testing (MGUT) as a feasible framework for evaluating the usability of non-immersive virtual reality (VR) learning applications. Conventionally, usability testing of such learning applications often employs the one-to-one approach in which an evaluator conducts testing with several individual participants. As opposed to the one-to-one approach, the group approach involves several-to-many participants performing tasks simultaneously, with several evaluators observing and interacting with participants. This article describes the complete step-by-step procedure for conducting MGUT to uncover usability problems of a VR learning application that aims to educate its users on fire safety and prevention. It also proposes methods to analyze these usability problems. The effectiveness and efficiency of MGUT was then compared with DGUT, the original group testing technique and cooperative evaluation (CE), which is a typical one-to-one approach. Results indicate that all three techniques are able to reveal usability problems of different usability factors and show similar capability to discover the most critical and serious problems. MGUT is more effective than DGUT as it can collect additional usability problems of various factors and of different levels of severity. MGUT is as effective as CE as both techniques can identify usability problems which are more or less comparable in terms of quantity and quality. As for efficiency, MGUT and DGUT are more efficient than CE as these group testing approaches require lesser testing time, lesser effort in terms of the intensive interaction with participants although with slight more effort in the preparation of the physical setting. In addition, it is also obvious that MGUT and DGUT involve richer participation than CE. MGUT is also more feasible than DGUT as it allows some flexibility in the computer arrangement setting.},

abstract={Introduction: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions (EFs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups. Materials and methods: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of EFs. Results: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients vs. the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of EFs (neuropsychological battery). Conclusion: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of EFs is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.},

abstract={The use of virtual reality for the provision of motor-cognitive gait training has been shown to be effective for a variety of patient populations. The interaction between the user and the virtual environment is achieved by tracking the motion of the body parts and replicating it in the virtual environment in real time. In this paper, we present the validation of a novel method for tracking foot position and orientation in real time, based on the Microsoft Kinect technology, to be used for gait training combined with virtual reality. The validation of the motion tracking method was performed by comparing the tracking performance of the new system against a stereo-photogrammetric system used as gold standard. Foot position errors were in the order of a few millimeters (average RMSD from 4.9 to 12.1 mm in the medio-lateral and vertical directions, from 19.4 to 26.5 mm in the anterior-posterior direction); the foot orientation errors were also small (average syntax error at token \\ from 5.6% to 8.8% in the medio-lateral and vertical directions, from 15.5% to 18.6% in the anterior-posterior direction). The results suggest that the proposed method can be effectively used to track feet motion in virtual reality and treadmill-based gait training programs.},

abstract={Background: In many telemedicine applications, the correct use of medical device at the point of need is essential to provide an appropriate service. Some applications may require untrained people to interact with medical devices and patients: care delivery in transportation, military actions, home care and telemedicine training. Appropriate operation of medical device and correct connection with patient's body are crucial. In these scenarios, tailored applications of Augmented Reality can offer a valid support by guiding untrained people at the point of need. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using Augmented Reality in telemedicine applications, by facilitating an acceptable use of biomedical equipment by any unskilled person. In particular, a prototype system was built in order to estimate how untrained users, with limited or no knowledge, can effectively interact with an ECG device and properly placing ECG electrodes on patient's chest. Methods: An Augmented Reality application was built to support untrained users in performing an ECG test. Simple markers attached to the ECG device and onto patient's thorax allow camera calibration. Once objects and their pose in the space are recognized, the video of the current scene is enriched, in real-time, with additional pointers, text boxes and audio that help the untrained operator to perform the appropriate sequence of operations. All the buttons, switches, ports of the ECG device together with the location of precordial leads were coded and indicated. Some user's voice commands were also included to improve usability. Results: Ten untrained volunteers, supported by the augmented reality, were able to carry out a complete ECG test first on a mannequin and then on a real patient in a reasonable time (about 8 minutes on average). Average positioning errors of precordial electrodes resulted less than 3 mm for the mannequin and less than 7 mm for the real patient. These preliminary findings suggest the effectiveness of the developed application and the validity of clinical ECG recordings. Conclusion: This application can be adapted to support the use of other medical equipment as well as other telemedicine tasks and it could be performed with a Tablet or a Smartphone.},

abstract={Automated perimetry is used for the assessment of visual function in a variety of ophthalmic and neurologic diseases. We report development and clinical testing of a compact, head-mounted, and eye-tracking perimeter (VirtualEye) that provides a more comfortable test environment than the standard instrumentation. VirtualEye performs the equivalent of a full threshold 24-2 visual field in two modes: (1) manual, with patient response registered with a mouse click, and (2) visual grasp, where the eye tracker senses change in gaze direction as evidence of target acquisition. 59 patients successfully completed the test in manual mode and 40 in visual grasp mode, with 59 undergoing the standard Humphrey field analyzer (HFA) testing. Large visual field defects were reliably detected by VirtualEye. Point-by-point comparison between the results obtained with the different modalities indicates: (1) minimal systematic differences between measurements taken in visual grasp and manual modes, (2) the average standard deviation of the difference distributions of about 5 dB, and (3) a systematic shift (of 4-6 dB) to lower sensitivities for VirtualEye device, observed mostly in high dB range. The usability survey suggested patients' acceptance of the head-mounted device. The study appears to validate the concepts of a head-mounted perimeter and the visual grasp mode.},

abstract={In construction process, defects occur inevitably and repeatedly. It is one of the primary causes of project schedule and cost overruns. Many studies on defect causation analysis and management system have been conducted to facilitate defect measures and rectifications as well as to reduce the reoccurrence of the defect. However, those studies did not sufficiently consider the relationship of defect information flow in the construction process, which resulted in reactive rather than proactive defect management plan. This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management. It is envisaged that the system framework and solutions could enable proactive reduction of the defect occurrence during the construction process and that could greatly improve current defect management practices in the construction industry.},

abstract={We sought to evaluate the accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT cameras for the measurement of left ventricular (LV) global and regional function, and the performance of absolute wall motion (WM) and wall thickness (WT) measurements for the detection of myocardial scarring, using cardiac MR as a reference. Sixty patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease underwent MPI using a CZT SPECT camera, as well as cine and delayed enhanced cardiac MR. Gated MPI data were processed using quantitative gated SPECT software. LV global function was assessed by measuring LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF). Regional function was assessed by quantifying segmental WM and WT according to the 17-segment model. Myocardial scarring was quantified on each segment using delayed enhanced cardiac MR. Agreement between SPECT and cardiac MR was assessed using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analyses. The influence of measurement magnitude on the agreement was analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficients between the mean and SD of measurements. The performance of WM and WT for the detection of segments with more than 25% scar transmurality was assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Correlation between methods was excellent for EF (R = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and ESV (R = 0.88, P < 0.0001) and was good for EDV (R = 0.71, P < 0.0001). Agreement was good for EF (bias, -2.7%; limits of agreement, -15.5 to +10.1) but was lower for EDV (bias, -29.7 mL; limits of agreement, -68.3 to +8.9) and ESV (bias, -9.9 mL; limits of agreement, -30.7 to +10.9). Correlation between methods was fair for WM (R = 0.49, P < 0.0001) and WT (R = 0.48, P < 0.0001). SPECT underestimated WT (bias, -41%; limits of agreement, -108 to +26), with an error depending on thickening magnitude (... = 0.70, P < 0.0001). The agreement in WM measurement was higher (bias, -1.4 mm; limits of agreement, -6.9 to +4) and independent of motion magnitude (... = 0.006, P = 0.86). WM and WT were equally able to identify scarred segments (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.74 ± 0.03 and 0.74 ± 0.03, respectively). MPI using CZT SPECT cameras and quantitative gated SPECT analysis accurately quantifies EF but still underestimates LV volumes. WM shows a higher agreement with cardiac MR than does WT, with errors in WT measurement increasing at greater thicknesses. Absolute quantification of segmental WM and WT can equally be used to identify myocardial scarring. (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae/symbols omitted.)},

abstract={Since the equipment early fault signal is very weak and unstable, it is very difficult to judge the fault type and fault degree through the traditional method of fault diagnosis .For this reason, this paper presents an effective method. Firstly, the fault signal is decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, then the IMF's energy entropy is calculated, the AR model is established, and the auto-regressive parameters are extracted. At the same time, the residual variance of the model is taken as the fault feature vector, which can be used as input parameters of SVM classifier to distinguish working state and fault types of the equipment. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by taking the rolling bearing fault diagnosis as an example.},

abstract={A Virtual Reality Environment (VRE), through which users are able to view and test ceramic tile products, is described. Virtual interfacing with the products generated emotional experiences in users that allowed them to feel engaged with the products. Users could choose between different kinds of products and test them out in order to know how they would look in a real-world context. Several mood-induction procedures for inducing relaxation were included. The VRE was tested with respect to its ability to induce relaxation and sense of presence in 26 participants, and the level of satisfaction was also analysed. Participants' satisfaction with the experience in the VRE was high, thus making it a useful tool for showing and testing products and for evoking a positive emotional association while users are interacting.},

abstract={In construction process, defects occur inevitably and repeatedly. It is one of the primary causes of project schedule and cost overruns. Many studies on defect causation analysis and management system have been conducted to facilitate defect measures and rectifications as well as to reduce the reoccurrence of the defect. However, those studies did not sufficiently consider the relationship of defect information flow in the construction process, which resulted in reactive rather than proactive defect management plan. This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management. It is envisaged that the system framework and solutions could enable proactive reduction of the defect occurrence during the construction process and that could greatly improve current defect management practices in the construction industry.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of homonymous visual field defects (HVFDs) on collision avoidance of dynamic obstacles at an intersection under virtual reality (VR) conditions. Overall performance was quantitatively assessed as the number of collisions at a virtual intersection at two difficulty levels. HVFDs were assessed by binocular semi-automated kinetic perimetry within the 90 degree visual field, stimulus III4e and the area of sparing within the affected hemifield (A-SPAR in deg2) was calculated. The effect of A-SPAR, age, gender, side of brain lesion, time since brain lesion and presence of macular sparing on the number of collisions, as well as performance over time were investigated. Thirty patients (10 female, 20 male, age range: 19-71 years) with HVFDs due to unilateral vascular brain lesions and 30 group-age-matched subjects with normal visual fields were examined. The mean number of collisions was higher for patients and in the more difficult level they experienced more collisions with vehicles approaching from the blind side than the seeing side. Lower A-SPAR and increasing age were associated with decreasing performance. However, in agreement with previous studies, wide variability in performance among patients with identical visual field defects was observed and performance of some patients was similar to that of normal subjects. Both patients and healthy subjects displayed equal improvement of performance over time in the more difficult level. In conclusion, our results suggest that visual-field related parameters per se are inadequate in predicting successful collision avoidance. Individualized approaches which also consider compensatory strategies by means of eye and head movements should be introduced.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of the virtual reality version of the Multiple Errands Test based on NeuroVR software as an assessment tool for executive functions. In particular, the Multiple Errands Test is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = I 0), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (I) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups. These results suggest a possible future application of such an ecological approach for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of stroke patients and elderly population with age-related cognitive decline.},

Major advances in medical device design and manufacture currently require extensive and expensive product cycles that include animal and clinical trials. The current design process limits opportunities to thoroughly understand and refine current designs and to explore new high-risk, high-payoff designs. For the past 4 years, our interdisciplinary research group has been working toward developing strategies to dramatically increase the role of simulation in medical device engineering, including linking simulations with visualization and interactive design. Although this vision aligns nicely with the stated goals of the FDA and the increasingly important role that simulation plays in engineering, manufacturing, and science today, the interdisciplinary expertise needed to realize a simulation-based visual design environment for real-world medical device design problems makes implementing (and even generating a system-level design for) such a system extremely challenging. In this paper, we present our vision for a new process of simulation-based medical device engineering and the impact it can have within the field. We also present our experiences developing the initial components of a framework to realize this vision and applying them to improve the design of replacement mechanical heart valves. Relative to commercial software packages and other systems used in engineering research, the vision and framework described are unique in the combined emphasis on 3D user interfaces, ensemble visualization, and incorporating state-of-the-art custom computational fluid dynamics codes. We believe that this holistic conception of simulation-based engineering, including abilities to not just simulate with unprecedented accuracy but also to visualize and interact with simulation results, is critical to making simulation-based engineering practical as a tool for major innovation in medical devices. Beyond the medical device arena, the framework and strategies described may well generalize to simulation-based engineering processes in other domains that also involve simulating, visualizing, and interacting with data that describe spatially complex time-varying phenomena.},

abstract={The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a widely used protocol to induce stress in laboratory settings. Briefly, in the TSST, the test participant is asked to hold a speech and to do an arithmetic task in front of an audience. In the present pilot study, we examined endocrine and autonomic reactivity and habituation to repeated stress provocations using a virtual reality (VR) version of TSST. The VR system was a CAVETM] system with three rear projected walls (4 mx 3 m), and one floor projection. The system also included a head tracking system and passive stereoscopy. The virtual audience consisted of one woman, and two men. ten healthy men, mean age 28.3 years (24-38 years), were confronted with the test twice (1 week between sessions), during which salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV, parasympathetic activity), and T-wave amplitude (TWA, suggested to be related to sympathetic influence on myocardial performance) were assessed. Cortisol secretion showed a marked increase (88% vs. baseline) during the first stress provocation, but habituated in the second session. The magnitude of HR and TWA reactivity during stress provocation was approximately the same at both sessions, implying a stable increase in sympathetic activity. Heart rate showed a maximum increase of 40% at the first session, and 32% at the second. TWA showed a maximum decrease of 42% at the first session, and 39% at the second. The results resemble those obtained in prior studies using the real-life TSST. If these results can be replicated with larger samples, VR technology may be used as a simple and standardized tool for social stress induction in experimental settings.},

abstract={Orthopedic drilling as a skill demands high levels of dexterity and expertise from the surgeon. It is a basic skill that is required in many orthopedic procedures. Inefficient drilling can be a source of avoidable medical errors that may lead to adverse events. It is hence important to train and evaluate residents in safe environments for this skill. This paper presents a virtual orthopedic drilling simulator that was designed to provide visiohaptic interaction with virtual bones. The simulation provides a realistic basic training environment for orthopedic surgeons. It contains modules to track and analyze movements of surgeons, in order to determine their surgical proficiency. The simulator was tested with senior surgeons, residents and medical students for validation purposes. Through the multi-tiered testing strategy it was shown that the simulator was able to produce a learning effect that transfers to real-world drilling. Further, objective measures of surgical performance were found to be able to differentiate between experts and novices.},

abstract={This work presents the results of a research project that evaluated the possibility to carry out ergonomic analyses on virtual prototypes that permitted tactile interaction. We propose an approach based on Virtual Reality (VR) and haptics: the former to improve visual rendering of a digital model, the latter to permit tactile interaction. The products considered were control boards. Atomic components such as knobs, sliders and buttons are employed. The paper presents the architecture of an ergonomic workstation and its first implementation based on commercial systems and ad hoc haptic devices specifically developed for the purpose. Major problems related to a VR environment, such as visualisation and human body tracking, are discussed; the architecture of haptic devices and technical solutions to achieve a satisfactory haptic rendering are presented. Finally, the paper proposes a test procedure and presents the results of tests on the behaviour of ergonomic workstation components. Work in progress and future developments conclude the paper.

abstract={An MR-compatible ergometer was developed for in-magnet whole-body human exercise testing. Designed on the basis of conventional mechanically braked bicycle ergometers and constructed from nonferrous materials, the ergometer was implemented on a 1.5-T whole-body MR scanner. A spectrometer interface was constructed using standard scanner hardware, complemented with custom-built parts and software to enable gated data acquisition during exercise. High-quality 31P NMR spectra were reproducibly obtained from the medial head of the quadriceps muscle of the right leg of eight healthy subjects during two-legged high-frequency pedaling (80 revolutions per minute) at three incremental workloads, including maximal. Muscle phosphocreatine content dropped 82%, from 32.2 +/- 1.0 mM at rest to 5.7 +/- 1.1 mM at maximal workload (mean +/- standard error; n = 8), indicating that the majority of quadriceps motor units were recruited. The cardiovascular load of the exercise was likewise significant, as evidenced by heart rates of 150 (+/-10%) beats per minute, measured immediately afterward. As such, the newly developed MR bicycling exercise equipment offers a powerful new tool for clinical musculoskeletal and cardiovascular MR investigation. The basic design of the ergometer is highly generic and adaptable for application on a wide selection of whole-body MR scanners. Magn Reson Med, 2010. copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This paper presents a methodology for the development of SFCSs that is based on virtual reality (VR) in order to assist the system designer at each stage of development. Exploiting VR helps the user to collect valid information quickly and in a correct form by putting the user and the information support elements in direct relation with the operation of the system in a more realistic environment. A VR-SFCS prototype tool is designed as a software system to realize the features outlined in each phase of the methodology. A set of rules and a knowledge base is appended to the methodology to remove any inconsistency that could arise between the material and the information flows during the development. A novel environment for matching the physical and the informational model domains is recommended in order to delineate the system requirements specification.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEWe developed and instituted a laparoscopic skills curriculum based on a virtual reality simulator, LapSim (Surgical Science, Göteborg, Sweden). Our goal was to improve basic skills in our residents. The hypothesis of this study is that performance in our course will differentiate levels of experience in the training program, establishing construct validity for our curriculum.DESIGNWe designed a novel curriculum that consisted of 17 practice modules and a 7-part examination. All residents who completed the curriculum successfully were included in this study. Performance to complete the examination was analyzed. Data were stratified by level of training.SETTINGUniversity surgical skill training laboratory.PARTICIPANTSIn all, 29 residents of all levels of training and 3 attending surgeons completed the curriculum.RESULTSThe average number of practice repetitions required was 243. To complete the examination component, junior residents (R1-R3) required more repetitions than senior residents (R4, R5), 28.3 versus 13.9, respectively (p < 0.002). Tasks on camera and instrument navigation as well as coordination did not reveal significant differences. The complex grasping task demonstrated significant differences in repetitions required for each level of training: 19.5 attempts for R1, 17.2 for R2, 13 for R3, 8.5 for R4, and 3 for R5 (p < 0.04). The 2 cutting drills, which required precise use of the left hand, required 7.9 repetitions for junior residents versus 2.7 for senior residents (p < 0.009). A clip application drill differentiated among junior residents with 39.4, 19.8, and 8.5 repetitions required for R1, R2, and R3, respectively (p < 0.05). Senior residents performed equivalent to attendings on this drill. A lifting and grasping drill differentiates among junior residents, senior residents, and attendings (p < 0.03).CONCLUSIONSIndividual performance in our curriculum correlates with the level of training for many drills, which establishes construct validity for this curriculum. Noncontributory drills may need to be revised or removed from the curriculum. Successful completion of this curriculum may lead to improved resident technical performance.},

For this study, a tracking error estimation algorithm with screen error estimation based on the characteristic of linecode marker was applied. It can rapidly estimate tracking error. An evaluation experiment was conducted to compare the estimated tracking error and the actual measured tracking error. Results show that the algorithm is reliable and sufficiently fast to be used for real-time tracking error warning or tracking accuracy improvement methods.},

abstract={The progression of neurodegenerative diseases as well as healthy aging is accompanied by structural changes of the brain. These changes are often only subtle when considered over time intervals of several months. Therefore morphometrical techniques for their detection in longitudinally acquired MR images must be highly sensitive, and they require a careful validation. In the present study, a novel processing chain for a longitudinal analysis based on deformation field morphometry is described. Procedures for its quantitative validation are also reported: Deformation fields were computed for the simulation of non-linear, local structural changes of human brains. Applying these deformation fields to "original" MR images yielded deformed MR images. The volume changes defined by the deformation fields represented the standard, against which the results of the longitudinal analysis of each pair of original and deformed MR image were compared. The proposed processing chain enabled to localize and to quantify simulated local atrophies near the cortex as well as in deep brain structures. An exemplary analysis of serial MR images of a patient suffering from an atypical Parkinson syndrome (cortico-basal degeneration, CBD) and healthy control subjects is presented, showing a characteristic pattern of volume changes in the brain of the patient which is strikingly different from the controls' patterns of changes.},

abstract={While standard neuropsychological measures have been found to have adequate predictive value, their ecological validity may diminish predictions about real world functioning. Virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly recognized as ecologically valid tools for neuropsychological assessment. We aim to develop a VE-based neuropsychological battery delivered within the context of a virtual city: Virtual Reality Cognitive Performance Assessment Test (VRCPAT). The 15 minute VRCPAT battery and 1.5 hour in-person neuropsychological assessment were conducted with a sample of 40 healthy adults, between the ages of 21 and 36, that included equivalent distributions of men and women from ethnically diverse populations. No subjects had history of psychiatric or neurologic conditions. Results supported both convergent and discriminant validity. The VRCPAT was found to correlate significantly with traditional neuropsychological tests assessing similar target constructs. No significant correlations existed between VRCPAT measures and non-target constructs. Findings suggest that the VRCPAT measures a capacity consistent with that of traditional neurocognitive measures; and is inconsistent with potential confounds. We conclude that the VRCPAT provides a unique opportunity to reliably and efficiently study neurocognitive function within an ecologically valid environment.},

abstract={This is a validation study, aiming to explore the effectiveness of a set of virtual environments for producing emotionally significant responses in students with high levels of test anxiety in order to be able to implement them later in treatment. Twenty-one students agreed to take part, 11 with high test anxiety and 10 with low test anxiety. The virtual environments were prepared in chronological order: the student's home, then the metro, and finally the corridor and lecture hall where the examination takes place. The results showed that the high-test-anxiety group presented higher levels of anxiety and depression than the low-test-anxiety group during exposure to the virtual environments. This study shows that virtual reality is able to provoke emotional responses in students with high test anxiety. This validation study should be followed up with treatment studies to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality therapy for treating test anxiety.},

abstract={As population-based epidemiologic studies may acquire images from thousands of subjects, automated image post-processing is needed. However, error in these methods may be biased and related to subject characteristics relevant to the research question. Here, we compare two automated methods of brain extraction against manually segmented images and evaluate whether method accuracy is associated with subject demographic and health characteristics. MRI data (n = 296) are from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, a population-based study of elderly Japanese-American men. The intracranial space was manually outlined on the axial proton density sequence by a single operator. The brain was extracted automatically using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) and BSE (Brain Surface Extractor) on axial proton density images. Total intracranial volume was calculated for the manually segmented images (ticvM), the BET segmented images (ticvBET) and the BSE segmented images (ticvBSE). Mean ticvBSE was closer to that of ticvM, but ticvBET was more highly correlated with ticvM than ticvBSE. BSE had significant over (positive error) and underestimated (negative error) ticv, but net error was relatively low. BET had large positive and very low negative error. Method accuracy, measured in percent positive and negative error, varied slightly with age, head circumference, presence of the apolipoprotein eepsilon4 polymorphism, subcortical and cortical infracts and enlarged ventricles. This epidemiologic approach to the assessment of potential bias in image post-processing tasks shows both skull-stripping programs performed well in this large image dataset when compared to manually segmented images. Although method accuracy was statistically associated with some subject characteristics, the extent of the misclassification (in terms of percent of brain volume) was small.},

The purpose of the proposed system is to test vehicle longitudinal control and warning algorithms such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), stop and go systems, and collision warning systems. For acceleration and deceleration situations which only need throttle movements, a vehicle longitudinal spacing control algorithm has been tested on the test bed. The spacing control algorithm has been designed based on sliding mode control and road grade estimation scheme which utilizes the vehicle engine torque map and gear shift information.},

abstract={A new structure for adaptive AR spectral estimation based on multi-band decomposition of the linear prediction error is introduced and the mathematical background for the solution of the related adaptive filtering problem is derived. The presented structure gives rise to AR spectral estimates that represent the true underlying spectrum with better fidelity than conventional LS methods by allowing an arbitrary trade-off between variance of spectral estimates and tracking ability of the estimator along the frequency spectrum. The linear prediction error is decomposed through a filter bank and components of each band are analyzed by different window lengths, allowing long windows to track slowly varying signals and short windows to observe fastly varying components. The correlation matrix of the input signal is shown to satisfy both time-update and order-update properties for rectangular windowing functions, and an RLS algorithm based on each property is presented. Adaptive forward and backward relations are used to derive a mathematical framework that serves as a basis for the design of fast RLS algorithms. Also, computer experiments comparing the performance of conventional and the proposed multi-band methods are depicted and discussed.},

However, the multiple regression models overestimate seasonality of temperature and mean annual and seasonal precipitation amounts for the two modern communities. Reasons for the models' inaccuracies may include, no African analog in the non-African database on which the model is based, too much intraspecific variability in leaf size (an important character in precipitation models), and relationships between leaf form and climate that may not be well defined by multiple regression. Mean annual temperatures were reconstructed for two Miocene paleobotanical localities from the Tugen Hills of the eastern rift valley, Kenya, using leaf form data (primarily margin characters).

This method determines the initial rate of contrast agent accumulation, the delayed rate of accumulation, and the maximum enhancement in each pixel. These three parameters allow characterization of the dynamic signal features. Simulated noisy test sets of dynamic enhancement curves have shown this method to yield a fast and accurate characterization of the dynamic signal. Clinical examples of both qualitative image parameter maps and quantitative statistical analysis of the parameter distributions demonstrated the quality and potential of the technique. The technique is designed to yield imaging and quantitative information on contrast agent accumulation that can be useful in detecting residual tumor and evaluating response to therapy, while requiring less than 7 minutes of imaging time and 5 minutes of processing time per study.},

abstract={A computerized system was developed to process standard spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data for estimation of brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes. In phantom experiments, the estimated volumes corresponded closely to the true volumes (r = .998), with a mean error less than 1.0 cm3 (for phantom volumes ranging from 5 to 35 cm3), with excellent intra- and interobserver reliability. In a clinical validation study with actual brain images of 10 human subjects, the average coefficient of variation between observers for the measurement of absolute brain and CSF volumes was 1.2% and 6.4%, respectively. The intraclass correlations for three expert operators is greater than .99 in the measurement of brain and ventricular volumes and greater than .94 for total CSF volume. Therefore, the authors believe that their technique to analyze MR images of the brain performed with acceptable levels of accuracy and reliability and that it can be used to measure brain and CSF volumes for clinical research. This technique could be helpful in the correlation of neuroanatomic measurements to behavioral and physiologic parameters in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract={The Talairach stereotactic proportional grid method for telencephalic localization was applied to magnetic resonance imaging of 30 brain hemispheres of healthy adult volunteers. Using sagittal images, outlines of the following characteristic principal sulci were identified on the brain surface to validate the method: callosal sulcus, parietooccipital sulcus, marginal sulcus, superomedial portion of central and postcentral sulcus, and posterior sylvian fissure. The maximal variation zones of sulcus location obtained by superimposition of the individual grid data on a standard proportional grid were similar to those originally reported by Talairach from pneumoencephalographic studies. However, the central sulcus, which was only studied postmortem by Talairach, was located 0.5-1 cm more posteriorly in the present study. Magnetic resonance also provided more detailed data on the considerable variation of the terminal parts of the sylvian fissure and on the well-known left-right asymmetries. The left sylvian fissure extended farther posteriorly in 11 of 15 brains. With the exception of this posterior perisylvian region, the proportional grid proved to be valid for indirect cerebral cortical localization in the regions studied.},

abstract={A boundary artifact in MR images due to truncation of the infinite Fourier series necessary to encode tissue discontinuities was investigated by using doped water phantoms and normal volunteers. All images were obtained on 0.3-T permanent and 0.6-T superconducting MR imagers with varying phase and frequency sampling rates. The artifact appeared in both the phase and frequency encoding direction as parallel lines or ringing adjacent to borders or tissue discontinuities. This was unlike motion artifacts, which occur predominantly in the phase direction, and chemical shift misregistration errors, which are most pronounced in the frequency direction. Increasing the sampling frequency from 128 to 512 resulted in higher frequency ringing and more rapid drop-off in amplitude. Low-pass digital filtering also decreased the ringing at the expense of fine detail. The truncation of the infinite Fourier series necessary to encode edges to the 128-512 terms used for most MR imaging produces the artifact. It is important to recognize this common artifact and not mistake it for patient motion or disease.},
