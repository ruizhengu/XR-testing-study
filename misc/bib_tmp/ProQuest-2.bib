abstract={ObjectiveTo explore the feasibility and effectiveness of mixed reality technology for localizing perforator vessels in the repair of mandibular defects using free fibular flap.MethodsBetween June 2020 and June 2023, 12 patients with mandibular defects were repaired with free fibular flap. There were 8 males and 4 females, with an average age of 61 years (range, 35-78 years). There were 9 cases of ameloblastomas and 3 cases of squamous cell carcinomas involving the mandible. The disease duration ranged from 15 days to 2 years (median, 14.2 months). The length of mandibular defects ranged from 5 to 14 cm (mean, 8.5 cm). The area of soft tissue defects ranged from 5 cm×4 cm to 8 cm×6 cm. Preoperative enhanced CT scans of the maxillofacial region and CT angiography of the lower limbs were performed, and the data was used to create three-dimensional models of the mandible and lower limb perforator vessels. During operation, the mixed reality technology was used to overlay the three-dimensional model of perforator vessels onto the body surface for harvesting the free fibular flap. The length of the fibula harvested ranged from 6 to 15 cm, with a mean of 9.5 cm; the size of the flap ranged from 6 cm×5 cm to 10 cm×8 cm. The donor sites were sutured directly in 7 cases and repaired with free skin grafting in 5 cases.ResultsThirty perforator vessels were located by mixed reality technology before operation, with an average of 2.5 vessels per case; the distance between the exit point of the perforator vessels located before operation and the actual exit point ranged from 1 to 4 mm, with a mean of 2.8 mm. All fibular flaps survived; 1 case had necrosis at the distal end of flap, which healed after dressing changes. One donor site had infection, which healed after anti-inflammatory dressing changes; the remaining incisions healed by first intention, and the grafts survived smoothly. All patients were followed up 8-36 months (median, 21 months). The repaired facial appearance was satisfactory, with no flap swelling. Among the patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy, 2 patients had normal bone healing and 1 had delayed healing at 6 months.ConclusionIn free fibular flap reconstruction of mandibular defects, the use of mixed reality technology for perforator vessel localization can achieve three-dimensional visualization, simplify surgical procedures, and reduce errors.},

abstract={Standard automated perimetery is considered the gold standard for evaluating a patient’s visual field. However, it is costly and requires a fixed testing environment. In response, perimetric devices using virtual reality (VR) headsets have emerged as an alternative way to measure visual fields in patients. This systematic review aims to characterize both novel and established VR headsets in the literature and explore their potential applications within visual field testing. A search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Core Collection (Web of Science) for articles published until January 2023. Subject headings and keywords related to virtual reality and visual field were used to identify studies specific to this topic. Records were first screened by title/abstract and then by full text using predefined criteria. Data was extracted accordingly. A total of 2404 records were identified from the databases. After deduplication and the two levels of screening, 64 studies describing 36 VR headset perimetry devices were selected for extraction. These devices encompassed various visual field measurement techniques, including static and kinetic perimetry, with some offering vision rehabilitation capabilities. This review reveals a growing consensus that VR headset perimetry devices perform comparably to, or even better than, standard automated perimetry. They are better tolerated by patients in terms of gaze fixation, more cost-effective, and generally more accessible for patients with limited mobility.Alternate abstract:摘要标准自动视野仪被视作评估患者视野的金标准。然而, 它价格昂贵并且需要固定的测试环境。因此, 使用虚拟现实(VR)耳机的视野仪器成为测量患者视野的替代方法。本综述旨在描述文献中新颖的和成熟的的VR耳机, 并探索它们在视野测试中的潜在应用。使用MEDLINE、Embase、CINAHL和Core Collection(Web of Science)等数据库对2023年1月之前发表的文章进行检索。使用与虚拟现实和视野相关的主题标题和关键词来确定与该主题相关的研究。记录首先通过标题/摘要进行筛选, 然后使用预定义的标准进行全文筛选。提取相应数据。从数据库中共识别出2404条记录。经过删除重复数据和两级筛选后, 选择64项研究36个VR耳机视野测量装置进行提取。这些设备包括各种视野测量技术, 包括静态和动态视野测量, 其中有些提供视力康复功能。本综述揭示了一个日益增长的共识, 即VR耳机视野检查装置的性能与标准自动视野检查相当, 甚至更好。在固视方面它们更容易被患者耐受, 更具成本效益, 并且对行动受限的患者可行性更高。},

abstract={Test anxiety is an emotional state characterized by subjective feelings of discomfort, fear, and worry that can considerably affect students’ academic performance. Virtual Reality exposure (VRE) is a promising approach to address test anxiety, but the few VRE systems for test anxiety in the literature concern only written exams. Since oral exams elicit more anxiety than written exams, the availability of VRE systems for oral exams would be precious to a large population of students worldwide. Another limitation of existing VRE systems for test anxiety is that they require the availability of a head-mounted display, posing a barrier to widespread use. This paper aims to address both issues, proposing a VRE system that deals with oral exams and can be used with common PC displays. The design of the proposed system is organized in three oral test scenarios in which a virtual agent acts as the student’s examiner. The virtual examiner behaves friendly in the first scenario and increasingly reduces its friendliness in the two subsequent scenarios. The paper assesses the feasibility for VRE of the proposed system with two complementary methods. First, we describe a quantitative user study of the three system scenarios, showing that they induce increasing levels of anxiety. Second, we present a qualitative thematic analysis of participants’ post-exposure interviews that sheds further light on the aspects of the virtual experience that contributed to eliciting negative or positive affect in participants, and provides insights for improving VRE systems for test anxiety.},

abstract={Digital technologies have changed almost every aspect of our lives, including the way we access heritage. Following the pandemic caused by COVID-19 and the technological evolution of recent years, museums and institutions, among others, have changed the way they display their collections, taking a greater interest in new technologies, platforms and digital software. This technological boom finds its greatest transformation with the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Metaverse in the museum sector. This article shows the concrete influence of VR/Metaverse in a museum room previously digitised through different techniques. Subsequently, the impact over user experience in the VR scenario versus on-site visit has been measured. In parallel, to measure the enzyme alpha-amylase in saliva, a cognitive test and usability test (SUS) were carried out to determine the learning capacity and degree of satisfaction obtained with experience alongside the room of the Museo de la Sangre in Murcia (Spain).},

abstract={For decades, manufacturers have attempted to reduce or eliminate the optical aberrations that appear on the progressive addition lens’ surfaces during manufacturing. Besides every effort made, some of these distortions are inevitable given how lenses are fabricated, where in fact, astigmatism appears on the surface and cannot be entirely removed, or where non-uniform magnification becomes inherent to the power change across the lens. Some presbyopes may refer to certain discomfort when wearing these lenses for the first time, and a subset of them might never adapt. Developing, prototyping, testing and purveying those lenses into the market come at a cost, which is usually reflected in the retail price. This study aims to test the feasibility of virtual reality (VR) for testing customers’ satisfaction with these lenses, even before getting them onto production. VR offers a controlled environment where different parameters affecting progressive lens comforts, such as distortions, image displacement or optical blurring, can be inspected separately. In this study, the focus was set on the distortions and image displacement, not taking blur into account. Behavioural changes (head and eye movements) were recorded using the built-in eye tracker. We found participants were significantly more displeased in the presence of highly distorted lens simulations. In addition, a gradient boosting regressor was fitted to the data, so predictors of discomfort could be unveiled, and ratings could be predicted without performing additional measurements.},

abstract={PurposeTo compare clinical visual field outputs in glaucoma and healthy patients returned by the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) and virtual reality (Virtual Field, VF) perimetry.MethodsOne eye of 54 glaucoma patients and 41 healthy subjects was prospectively tested (three times each in random order) using the HFA and VF perimeters (24‐2 test grids). We extracted and compared global indices (mean deviation MD] and pattern standard deviation PSD]), pointwise sensitivity (and calculated ‘equivalent’ sensitivity after accounting for differences in background luminance) and pointwise defects. Bland–Altman (mean difference Mdiff] and 95% limits of agreement LoA]) and intraclass correlation analyses were performed.ResultsThe VF test was shorter (by 76 s) and had lower fixation losses (by 0.08) and false‐positive rate (by 0.01) compared to the HFA (all p < 0.0001). Intraclass correlations were 0.86, 0.82 and 0.47 for MD, PSD and pointwise sensitivity between devices, respectively. Test–retest variability was higher for VF (Mdiff 0.3 dB, LoA −7.6 to 8.2 dB) compared to the HFA (Mdiff −0.3 dB, LoA −6.4 to 5.9 dB), indicating greater test–retest variability. When using each device's underlying normative database, the HFA detected, on average, 7 more defects (at the p < 0.05 level) out of the 52 test locations compared to this iteration of VF in the glaucoma cohort.ConclusionsVirtual Field returns global results that are correlated with the HFA, but pointwise sensitivities were more variable. Differences in test–retest variability and defect detection by its current normative database raise questions about the widespread adoption of VF in lieu of the HFA.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) is a valuable tool for the treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders and dysfunctional behaviors. Although VR software is mainly developed following a disorder-specific approach, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the efficacy of a new transdiagnostic VR application (H.O.M.E. VR-based psychological intervention) in improving dysfunctional behaviors, three transdiagnostic factors concurrently (emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, and psychological flexibility), and stress. Three groups screened as at-risk for nicotine dependence, alcohol abuse, and eating disorders will be assigned to the H.O.M.E. VR intervention and compared to a waiting-list (WL) condition. Participants will be assessed before and after the H.O.M.E. intervention/WL and at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups in the levels of the displayed dysfunctional behavior, the three transdiagnostic factors, and stress. Changes in dysfunctional behaviors, transdiagnostic factors, and stress in each population VR group and differences in such improvements between each population of the VR and WL groups will be evaluated using mixed-model repeated measure analyses of variance. It is expected that, after the H.O.M.E. intervention and at follow-ups, participants will display improvements in physical and psychological health compared to controls. The H.O.M.E. protocol is expected to result in a cost-effective option to tackle cognitive-behavioral factors shared among several psychopathologies and dysfunctional behaviors.},

abstract={BackgroundNew digital technologies (augmented reality headsets, eye-tracking) may potentially allow for automated assessments of ocular misalignment. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of a novel, open-source strabismus test (“STARE”) as an automated screening tool.MethodsWork progressed in 2 phases. In phase 1 (“development”), we used Fresnel prisms to elicit horizontal misalignments of known magnitude (1–40 prism dioptres) in orthotropic controls. In phase 2 (“validation”), we applied the system to adults with an established diagnosis of strabismus, and quantified the ability of the test to distinguish between those with horizontal misalignment and those without. Agreement between the alternate prism cover test measurements and STARE measurements was computed using Bland–Altman plots and product-moment correlation coefficients.ResultsSeven orthotropic controls and nineteen patients with strabismus were recruited (mean age 58.7 ± 22.4 years). STARE was able to identify the presence of horizontal strabismus with an area under the curve of 1.00 (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). The mean difference (bias) {95% CI} was 2.1 {−1.8, 9.9} prism dioptres, and the 95% coefficient of repeatability {95% CI} was ±27.9 {14.8, 50.8} prism dioptres. The Pearson correlation between APCT and STARE was r24 = 0.62, P < 0.001.ConclusionsSTARE shows promise as a simple, automated tool for performing a screening assessment of strabismus. It is a rapid (60 s) test that can be performed using a consumer augmented reality headset with integrated eye-tracking, and might conceivably be used remotely by non-specialists in future as a means of highlighting individuals needing face-to-face specialist care.},

Because of the amount of effort and time required to develop a new immersive environment (IE), evaluating its relevance and effectiveness appears to be a paramount factor for a wider adoption of these technologies in the industry. Previous works have already investigated the roots of this slow adoption, but to the best of our knowledge none of them give a detailed overview of the specific and decisive stage of the evaluation of new IEs before a possible implementation. Through a detailed study of 101 scientific papers published between 2000 and early 2021, this work therefore intends to provide an overview of existing studies involving XR experience design, evaluation approaches, and materials to help identify the areas that could require more targeted research to improve the adoption of immersive technologies in the industry. To do so, we propose an analytical framework combining key factors to assess user-centered evaluation and perform a systematic literature review to establish the current status of these factors. Results show the variety of assessment methods used and the emergence of new physiological technologies over recent years. Constraints related to the user-centered evaluation methodology are also identified and discussed.},

abstract={IntroductionObsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by recurrent, repetitive, and unwanted thoughts or impulses triggering significant anxiety. Exposure and response prevention is currently the first-line therapy for OCD. The goal of this validation study was to confirm the potential of the VR house environment that incorporates OCD-specific items that cluster around major symptom dimensions: ‘contamination’, ‘symmetry’, ‘checking’ and ‘hoarding’ to induce anxiety and compulsive behaviour in patients with OCD.MethodWe assessed a sample of OCD patients (n = 44) that was compared to a group of healthy controls (n = 31). The severity of OCD symptoms was assessed in all subjects. During a single session, participants were asked to approach a set of 10 stimuli (covering four OCD dimensions) and rate their current intensity of distress/anxiety and compulsive tendencies (scales 0–5) provoked by observing each stimulus. Before and after the VR exposure, participants completed questionnaires assessing subjective levels of anxiety (before/after VR exposure), their sense of presence in VR and experienced simulator sickness.ResultsThe results show that the OCD group reports elevated levels of distress and compulsive behaviour when confronted with VR exposure stimuli compared to the control group, but no increase in anxiety levels has been observed after the VR exposure. The subjective ratings of provoked distress and compulsive behaviour are not associated with severity of OCD symptoms, perceived sense of presence, association with cybersickness symptoms is weak.ConclusionOur data suggest that the VR house environment is a suitable tool for VR exposure therapy in OCD patients as it demonstrates OCD symptom provocation relevant for individual patients.},

abstract={Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) is a kind of intracerebral bleeding disease that affects 2.5 per 10,000 people world wide each year. An effective way of curing this disease is to perform a puncture procedure through the dura with a brain puncture drill and tube. The insertion accuracy determines the quality of surgery. Currently, augmented reality—and mixed reality (MR)-based surgical navigation is a promising new technology for surgical navigation in the clinic, aiming to improve the safety and accuracy of surgery. In this study, we present a novel multimodel MR navigation system for HICH surgery. With multi-information fusion technology, organs and hematoma data extracted from CT images can be fused with real patient, which allows surgeons to perform punctures easily. An automatic registration method with a 3D-printed fiducial marker was performed to significantly decrease the time required for surgery preparation.Phantom experiments and user tests were performed in this study, the results of these phantom experiments demonstrated that the mean registration error was 1.18 mm, the insertion error was 1.74 and the average time consumption was 15.9 min, which indicating that this approach was sufficient for clinical application. All the experimental results indicated that this system shows particular promise for use in training inexperienced surgeons, and the next steps would be to refine the system based on the findings with more experienced surgeons.},

abstract={The latest technological advancements in the domain of virtual reality (VR) have created new opportunities to use VR as a training platform for medical students and practitioners more broadly. Despite the growing interest in the use of VR as a training tool, a commonly identified gap in VR-training for medical education is the confidence in the long-term validity of the applications. A systematic literature review was undertaken to explore the extent of VR (in particular head-mounted displays) applications for medical training with an additional focus on validation measures. The papers included in this review discussed empirical case studies of specific applications; however, these were mostly concerned with human–computer interaction and were polarized between demonstrating that a conceptual technology solution was feasible for simulation or looked at specific areas of VR usability with little discussion on validation measures for long-term training effectiveness and outcomes. The review uncovered a wide range of ad hoc applications and studies in terms of technology vendors, environments, tasks, envisaged users and effectiveness of learning outcomes. This presents decision-making challenges for those seeking to adopt, implement and embed such systems in teaching practice. The authors of this paper then take a wider socio-technical systems perspective to understand how the holistic training system can be engineered and validated effectively as fit for purpose, through distillation of a generic set of requirements from the literature review to aid design specification and implementation, and to drive more informed and traceable validation of these types of systems. In this review, we have identified 92 requirement statements in 11 key areas against which a VR-HMD training system could be validated; these were grouped into design considerations, learning mechanisms and implementation considerations.},

abstract={Previous studies showed similar spatial orientation ability (SO) between real world (RW) and virtual reality (VR). As the SO deteriorates with age, it is crucial to investigate whether the degradation is similar in VR, as it may affect the use of VR tools for older people, such as in physical therapy. Therefore, we extended our previous study, in which similar SO between RW and VR was measured for younger participants (18–35 years) with a higher age group (> 55 years) to examine the VR's influence on their SO. Two main tests were conducted. In the first test, the participants were blindfolded, asked to rotate (0°, 45°, 180°, 225°) on a fixed starting position, and walk straight to different objects they had memorized before. This test was conducted twice. An ANOVA only revealed a significant interaction between the factors Age (young/old) and Condition (VR/RW) for the 45°-rotation in the second run. Here, both age groups performed similarly in RW, while in VR, greater deviations in the older participants appeared. Nevertheless, the overall Age*Condition-interaction in the first test was not significant. In the second test, subjects were required to walk blindfolded to two objects starting from different positions. The starting position and objects changed three times in each condition but were equal between RW and VR. No interactions between the factors Age and Condition were found (p > 0.05). Both tests showed a similar influence of VR on the SO of both age groups, supporting the usage of VR, regardless of age.},

abstract={Natural resource management is rapidly shifting to incorporate a deeper understanding of ecological processes and functioning, including attention to invasive species. The shift to understand public perceptions of resource management and invasives is much slower. Information influences both landscape preference and behaviors. Theory suggests that increasingly engaging information should have concurrently greater impacts. This research tested the effect of increasingly engaging information on visitor preferences and intentions to return to landscapes treated in response to emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis). Park visitors in a midwestern-U.S. state randomly received one of four messages about forest management in response to EAB (control, photo, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)). Messaging impacted preferences for three of the four management approaches, but significant changes in displacement intentions emerged in only one of the four. Specifically, VR and AR increased preferences for complete harvest compared to photos/text, but not differently from those who received no information. VR significantly lowered preferences for select harvest with natural regeneration. The photo/text treatment increased preference for select harvest with planted trees over no information. Any information reduced displacement in response to a photo depicting “select harvest, planted trees.” Subsequently judicious use of advanced communications like VR can optimize increasing scarce resources and maintain or optimize ecological services. Future research directions across geographic and content areas are recommended.},

abstract={A direct application of autoregressive (AR) models with independent and identically distributed (iid) errors is sometimes inadequate to fit the time series data well. A natural alternative is further to assume the model errors following an AR process, whose structure however has essential impacts on the statistical inferences related to the autoregressive models. In this paper, we construct a new unified test for checking the AR error structure based on the empirical likelihood method. The proposed test is desirable because its limit distribution is always chi-squared regardless of whether the autoregressive model is stationary or non-stationary, with or without an intercept term. Some simulations are also provided to illustrate the finite sample performance of this test. Finally, we apply the proposed test to a financial real data set.},

abstract={Brain tumors are abnormal cell growth in the brain tissues that can be cancerous or not. In any case, they could be a very aggressive disease that should be detected as early as possible. Usually, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main tool commonly adopted by neurologists and radiologists to identify and classify any possible anomalies present in the brain anatomy. In the present work, an automatic unsupervised method called Z2-γ, based on the use of adaptive finite-elements and suitable pre-processing and post-processing techniques, is introduced. The adaptive process, driven by a Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimator (Z2), is carried out on isotropic triangulations, while the given input images are pre-processed via nonlinear transformations (γ corrections) to enhance the ability of the error estimator to detect any relevant anomaly. The proposed methodology is able to automatically classify whether a given MR image represents a healthy or a diseased brain and, in this latter case, is able to locate the tumor area, which can be easily delineated by removing any redundancy with post-processing techniques based on morphological transformations. The method is tested on a freely available dataset achieving 0.846 of accuracy and F1 score equal to 0.88.},

abstract={Evacuation signs are one of the key factors which influence the building evacuation efficiency and evacuees’ route choice behaviors. It is important to test the effectiveness of evacuation signs, and an eye movement test was verified to be a good way. In this paper, both reality and MR (Mixed-Reality) evacuation experiments were carried out to collect the eye movement data of participants, such as gaze position, fixation duration, and number of gazes. In the reality experiment, participants took part in an emergency evacuation at a T-junction corridor with the glass-type eye-tracking device. In order to collect eye movement data in the MR experiment, the eye tracking device was integrated into the Microsoft HoloLens device (MR-ET for short). In either reality or MR experiments, each participant took part in five sub-experiments with five different types of evacuation signs. It was found that (1) the evacuation signs with a black background, green foreground and flashing lights have a better effect in guidance; (2) the flashing lights can better attract the attention of the participants, and enhanced the participants’ understanding of the signs. (3) An X-mark will hinder participants’ understanding of the signs and increase their reaction time. According to the results of the experiments, it is also found that the eye-tracking test in an MR environment is also a good method to test the effectiveness of the evacuation signs, and such a method can also be used in building safety design without damaging a wall or changing the reality environment of a building.},

abstract={Background Mixed Reality technology may provide many advantages over traditional teaching methods. Despite its potential, the technology has yet to be used for the formal assessment of clinical competency. This study sought to collect validity evidence and assess the feasibility of using the HoloLens 2 mixed reality headset for the conduct and augmentation of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted to compare the assessment of undergraduate medical students undertaking OSCEs via HoloLens 2 live (HLL) and recorded (HLR), and gold-standard in-person (IP) methods. An augmented mixed reality scenario was also assessed. Results Thirteen undergraduate participants completed a total of 65 OSCE stations. Overall inter-modality correlation was 0.81 (p = 0.01), 0.98 (p = 0.01) and 0.82 (p = 0.01) for IP vs. HLL, HLL vs. HLR and IP vs. HLR respectively. Skill based correlations for IP vs. HLR were assessed for history taking (0.82, p = 0.01), clinical examination (0.81, p = 0.01), procedural (0.88, p = 0.01) and clinical skills (0.92, p = 0.01), and assessment of a virtual mixed reality patient (0.74, p = 0.01). The HoloLens device was deemed to be usable and practical (Standard Usability Scale (SUS) score = 51.5), and the technology was thought to deliver greater flexibility and convenience, and have the potential to expand and enhance assessment opportunities. Conclusions HoloLens 2 is comparable to traditional in-person examination of undergraduate medical students for both live and recorded assessments, and therefore is a valid and robust method for objectively assessing performance. The technology is in its infancy, and users need to develop confidence in its usability and reliability as an assessment tool. However, the potential to integrate additional functionality including holographic content, automated tracking and data analysis, and to facilitate remote assessment may allow the technology to enhance, expand and standardise examinations across a range of educational contexts.},

abstract={Neuropsychological screening tools for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been widely used. However, to date, their sensitivity and specificity still remain unsatisfied. This study aims to investigate whether spatial memory can discriminate MCI better than neuropsychological screening tools. A total of 56 healthy older adults and 36 older adults with MCI participated in this study; they performed a spatial cognitive task based on virtual reality (SCT-VR), the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-K), and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design Test (WAIS-BDT). The discriminant power was compared between the SCT-VR and the MoCA-K, and the reliability and validity of the SCT-VR were analyzed. The spatial memory, assessed by the SCT-VR, showed better sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity: 0.944; specificity: 0.964) than the MoCA-K (sensitivity: 0.857; specificity: 0.746). The test-retest reliability of the SCT-VR was relatively high (ICCs: 0.982, p < 0.001) and the concurrent validity of the SCT-VR with the MoCA-K (r = −0.587, p < 0.001) and the WAIS-BDT (r = −0.594, p < 0.001) was statistically significant. These findings shed light on the importance of spatial memory as a behavioral marker of MCI. The ecologically validated spatial memory tasks based on VR need to be investigated by neuroscientific studies in the future.},

abstract={This study investigates the impact of an efficacy-focused virtual reality (VR) intervention designed according to instructional design principles on eating behavior. In the preregistered intervention study, psychology students were randomly assigned to nine seminar blocks. Employing parallel design, they were allocated to either a VR intervention to experience the environmental impact of food behavior (1) and alter the future by revising food choices (2) or to a passive control condition. The data from 123 participants (78% female, mean age 25.03, SD = 6.4) were analyzed to investigate the effect of the VR intervention on dietary footprint measured from 1 week before to 1 week after the intervention. The VR intervention decreased individual dietary footprints (d = 0.4) significantly more than the control condition. Similarly, the VR condition increased response efficacy and knowledge to a larger extent compared to the control. For knowledge, the effect persisted for 1 week. The VR intervention had no impact on intentions, self-efficacy, or psychological distance. Additional manipulation of normative feedback enhanced self-efficacy; however, manipulation of geographical framing did not influence psychological distance.

abstract={Spatial navigation impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been suggested to underlie patients experiencing spatial disorientation. Though many studies have highlighted navigation impairments for AD patients in virtual reality (VR) environments, the extent to which these impairments predict a patient’s risk for spatial disorientation in the real world is still poorly understood. The aims of this study were to (a) investigate the spatial navigation abilities of AD patients in VR environments as well as in a real world community setting and (b) explore whether we could predict patients at a high risk for spatial disorientation in the community based on their VR navigation. Sixteen community-dwelling AD patients and 21 age/gender matched controls were assessed on their egocentric and allocentric navigation abilities in VR environments using the Virtual Supermarket Test (VST) and Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) as well as in the community using the Detour Navigation Test (DNT). When compared to controls, AD patients exhibited impairments on the VST, SHQ, and DNT. For patients, only SHQ wayfinding distance and wayfinding duration significantly predicted composite disorientation score on the DNT (β = 0.422, p = 0.034, R2 = 0.299 and β = 0.357, p = 0.046, R2 = 0.27 respectively). However, these same VR measures could not reliably predict which patients were at highest risk of spatial disorientation in the community (p > 0.1). Future studies should focus on developing VR-based tests which can predict AD patients at high risk of getting spatially disorientated in the real world.},

abstract={The value of kinematic data for skill assessment is being investigated. This is the first virtual reality simulator developed for liver surgery. This simulator was coded in C++ using PhysX and FleX with a novel cutting algorithm and used a patient data-derived model and two instruments functioning as ultrasonic shears. The simulator was evaluated by nine expert surgeons and nine surgical novices. Each participant performed a simulated metastasectomy after training. Kinematic data were collected for the instrument position. Each participant completed a survey. The expert participants had a mean age of 47 years and 9/9 were certified in surgery. Novices had a mean age of 30 years and 0/9 were certified surgeons. The mean path length (novice 0.76 ± 0.20 m vs. expert 0.46 ± 0.16 m, p = 0.008), movements (138 ± 45 vs. 84 ± 32, p = 0.043) and time (174 ± 44 s vs. 102 ± 42 s, p = 0.004) were significantly different for the two participant groups. There were no significant differences in activating the instrument (107 ± 25 vs. 109 ± 53). Participants considered the simulator realistic (6.5/7) (face validity), appropriate for education (5/7) (content validity) with an effective interface (6/7), consistent motion (5/7) and realistic soft tissue behavior (5/7). This study showed that the simulator differentiates between experts and novices. Simulation may be an effective way to obtain kinematic data.},

abstract={Immersive virtual reality (VR) is increasingly applied in various areas of life. The potential of this technology has also been noticed in recreational physical activity and sports. It appears that a virtual environment can also be used in diagnosing certain psychomotor abilities. The main aim of this study consisted of assessing the relevance and reliability of VR-implemented tests of simple and complex reaction time (RT) performed by mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters. Thirty-two professional MMA fighters were tested. The original test developed in the virtual environment was applied for RT assessment. The fighters’ task consisted of reacting to the lighting up of a virtual disc situated in front of them by pushing a controller button. The relevance of the test task was estimated by juxtaposing the obtained results with the classic computer test used for measuring simple and complex reactions, while its reliability was assessed with the intraclass correlation procedure. Significant relationships found between the results of VR-implemented tests and computer-based tests confirmed the relevance of the new tool for the assessment of simple and complex RT. In the context of their reliability, RT tests in VR do not differ from tests conducted with the use of standard computer-based tools. VR technology enables the creation of tools that are useful in diagnosing psychomotor abilities. Reaction time tests performed by MMA fighters with the use of VR can be considered relevant, and their reliability is similar to the reliability obtained in computer-based tests.},

abstract={Gait deficits are often persistent after stroke, and current rehabilitation methods do not restore normal gait for everyone. Targeted methods of focused gait therapy that meet the individual needs of each stroke survivor are needed. Our objective was to develop and test a combination protocol of simultaneous brain stimulation and focused stance phase training for people with chronic stroke (>6 months). We combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with targeted stance phase therapy using Virtual Reality (VR)-assisted treadmill training and overground practice. The training was guided by motor learning principles. Five users (>6 months post-stroke with stance phase gait deficits) completed 10 treatment sessions. Each session began with 30 min of VR-assisted treadmill training designed to apply motor learning (ML)-based stance phase targeted practice. During the first 15 min of the treadmill training, bihemispheric tDCS was simultaneously delivered. Immediately after, users completed 30 min of overground (ML)-based gait training. The outcomes included the feasibility of protocol administration, gait speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), paretic limb stance phase control capability, and the Fugl–Meyer for lower extremity coordination (FMLE). The changes in the outcome measures (except the assessments of stance phase control capability) were calculated as the difference from baseline. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed after 10 treatment sessions in gait speed (0.25 ± 0.11 m/s) and FGA (4.55 ± 3.08 points). Statistically significant improvements were observed in TUG (2.36 ± 3.81 s) and FMLE (4.08 ± 1.82 points). A 10-session intervention combining tDCS and ML-based task-specific gait rehabilitation was feasible and produced clinically meaningful improvements in lower limb function in people with chronic gait deficits after stroke. Because only five users tested the new protocol, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population. As a contribution to the field, we developed and tested a protocol combining brain stimulation and ML-based stance phase training for individuals with chronic stance phase deficits after stroke. The protocol was feasible to administer; statistically and/or clinically significant improvements in gait function across an array of gait performance measures were observed with this relatively short treatment protocol.},

abstract={Collaborative robots (cobots) could help humans in tasks that are mundane, dangerous or where direct human contact carries risk. Yet, the collaboration between humans and robots is severely limited by the aspects of the safety and comfort of human operators. In this paper, we outline the use of extended reality (XR) as a way to test and develop collaboration with robots. We focus on virtual reality (VR) in simulating collaboration scenarios and the use of cobot digital twins. This is specifically useful in situations that are difficult or even impossible to safely test in real life, such as dangerous scenarios. We describe using XR simulations as a means to evaluate collaboration with robots without putting humans at harm. We show how an XR setting enables combining human behavioral data, subjective self-reports, and biosignals signifying human comfort, stress and cognitive load during collaboration. Several works demonstrate XR can be used to train human operators and provide them with augmented reality (AR) interfaces to enhance their performance with robots. We also provide a first attempt at what could become the basis for a human–robot collaboration testing framework, specifically for designing and testing factors affecting human–robot collaboration. The use of XR has the potential to change the way we design and test cobots, and train cobot operators, in a range of applications: from industry, through healthcare, to space operations.},

abstract={Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that has been used to provide the Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) illusion to patients with promising results. In the present work, the goal is to design, develop and test a portable VR-based MVF system that monitors behavioral information about the performance of a simple motor task. The developed application runs in a stand-alone VR system and allows the researcher to select the real and virtual hands used to perform the motor task. The system was evaluated with a group of twenty healthy volunteers (12 men and 8 women) with ages between 18 and 66 years. Participants had to repetitively perform a motor task in four different experimental conditions: two mirror conditions (performing real movements with the dominant and with the non-dominant hand) and two non-mirror conditions. A significant effect of the experimental condition on embodiment score (p < 0.001), response time (p < 0.001), performance time (p < 0.001), trajectory length (p < 0.004) and trajectory maximum horizontal deviation (p < 0.001) was observed. Furthermore, a significant effect of the experimental moment (initial, middle and final parts of the training) on the performance time was observed (p < 0.001). These results show that the monitored parameters provide relevant information to evaluate the participant’s task performance in different experimental conditions.},

abstract={Background After a stroke, experts recommend regular monitoring and kinematic assessments of patients to objectively measure motor recovery. With the rise of new technologies and increasing needs for neurorehabilitation, an interest in virtual reality has emerged. In this context, we have developed an immersive virtual reality version of the Box and Block Test (BBT-VR). The aim of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of the BBT-VR among patients with stroke and healthy participants. Methods Twenty-three healthy participants and 22 patients with stroke were asked to perform the classical Box and Block Test (BBT) and BBT-VR three times with both hands. Concurrent validity was assessed through correlations between these two tests and reliability of the BBT-VR through correlation on test–retest. Usability of the BBT-VR was also evaluated with the System Usability Scale. Hand kinematic data extracted from controller’s 3D position allowed to compute mean velocity (Vmean), peak velocity (Vpeak) and smoothness (SPARC). Results Results showed strong correlations between the number of blocks displaced with the BBT and the BBT-VR among patients with stroke for affected (r = 0.89; p  0.8; p < 0.001) and usability almost excellent (System Usability Scale = 79 ± 12.34%). On average participants moved between 30 and 40% less blocks during the BBT-VR than during the BBT. Healthy participants demonstrated significantly higher kinematic measures (Vmean = 0.22 ± 0.086 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.96 ± 0.341 ms−1; SPARC = − 3.31 ± 0.862) than patients with stroke (Vmean = 0.12 ± 0.052 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.60 ± 0.202 ms−1; SPARC = − 5.04− 7.050 to − 3.682]). Conclusion The BBT-VR is a usable, valid and reliable test to assess manual dexterity, providing kinematic parameters, in a population of patients with stroke and healthy participants.

abstract={Stroke, affecting approximately 15 million people worldwide, has long been a global cause of death and disability. Virtual Reality (VR) has shown its potential as an assistive tool for post-stroke rehabilitation. The objective of this pilot study was to define the task-specific performance metrics of VR tasks to assess the performance level of healthy subjects and patients quantitatively and to obtain their feedback for improving the developed framework. A pilot prospective study was designed. We tested the designed VR tasks on forty healthy right-handed subjects to evaluate its potential. Qualitative trajectory plots and three quantitative performance metrics—time taken to complete the task, percentage relative error, and trajectory smoothness—were computed from the recorded data of forty healthy subjects. Two patients with stroke were also enrolled to compare their performance with healthy subjects. Each participant received one VR session of 90 min. No adverse effects were noticed throughout the study. Performance metrics obtained from healthy subjects were used as a reference for patients. Relatively higher values of task completion time and trajectory smoothness and lower values of relative % error was observed for the affected hands w.r.t the unaffected hands of both the patients. For the unaffected hands of both the patients, the performance levels were found objectively closer to that of healthy subjects. A library of VR tasks for wrist and fingers were designed, and task-specific performance metrics were defined in this study. The evaluation of the VR exercises using these performance metrics will help the clinicians to assess the patient’s progress quantitatively and to design the rehabilitation framework for a future clinical study.},

abstract={Programming is a skill that requires high levels of logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. According to the Curriculum Guidelines for the 12-Year Basic Education currently implemented in Taiwan, programming has been included in the mandatory courses of middle and high schools. Nevertheless, the guidelines simply recommend that elementary schools conduct fundamental instructions in related fields during alternative learning periods. This may result in the problem of a rough transition in programming learning for middle school freshmen. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an augmented reality (AR) logic programming teaching system that combines AR technologies and game-based teaching material designs on the basis of the fundamental concepts for seventh-grade structured programming. This system can serve as an articulation curriculum for logic programming in primary education. Thus, students are able to develop basic programming logic concepts through AR technologies by performing simple command programming. This study conducted an experiment using the factor-based quasi-experimental research design and questionnaire survey method, with 42 fifth and sixth graders enrolled as the experimental subjects. The statistical analysis showed the following results: In terms of learning effectiveness, both AR-based and traditional learning groups displayed a significant performance. However, of the two groups, the former achieved more significant effectiveness in the posttest results. Regarding learning motivation, according to the evaluation results of the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model, the AR-based learning group manifested significantly higher levels of learning motivation than the traditional learning group, with particularly significant differences observed in the dimension of Attention. Therefore, the experimental results validate that the proposed AR-based logic programming teaching system has significant positive effects on enhancing students’ learning effectiveness and motivation.},

abstract={Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in heathy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artefacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.},

abstract={Virtual reality-induced motion sickness (VRMS) is a relevant limiting factor in the use of VR devices. Understanding the origin of this problem might help to develop strategies to circumvent this limitation. Previous studies have attributed VRMS to a mismatch between visual, and vestibular information, causing ambiguity of the position of the body in relation to its surrounding. Studies using EEG have shown a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies while VRMS is experienced. However, little is known about the relationship between the intensity of the VRMS and the changes in these power spectra. Moreover, the effect of different varieties of VRMS on the causal relationship between brain areas is largely unknown. Here we used EEG to study 14 healthy subjects in a VR environment who were exposed to increasing levels of mismatch between vestibular and visual information. The frequency power and the bivariate transfer entropy as a measure for the information transfer were calculated. We found a direct association between increasing mismatch levels and subjective VRMS. With increasing VRMS, the proportion of slow EEG waves (especially 1-10 Hz) increases, especially in temporo-occipital regions. Furthermore, we found a general decrease in the information flow in most brain areas but especially in brain areas involved in the processing of vestibular signals and the detection of self-motion. We hypothesize that the general shift of frequency power and the decrease in information flow while experiencing high intensity VRMS represent a brain state of a reduced ability to receive, transmit and process information. We further hypothesize that the mechanism of reduced information flow is a general reaction of the brain to an unresolvable mismatch of information. This reaction aims on transforming a currently unstable model with a high prediction error into a stable model in an environment of minimal contradictory information.},

abstract={Purpose High resolution flat-panel computed tomography arthrography (FPCT-A) and magnetic resonance arthrography (MR-A) are well suited to evaluate osteochondral lesions. The current study compares the performance of FPCT-A versus MR-A in an experimental setting. Methods Fourteen cadaveric ankles were prepared with artificial osteochondral defects of various sizes in four separate talar locations. After intra-articular contrast injection, FPCT-A and 3-T MR-A were acquired. Each defect was then filled with synthetic pallets. The resulting cast was used as reference. Two independent radiologists measured the dimensions of all defects with FPCT-A and MR-A. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Data were compared using t-tests and Bland-Altman plots. Results The correlation for FPCT-A and cast was higher compared to MR-A and cast (ICC 0.876 vs. 0.799 for surface length x width]; ICC 0.887 vs. 0.866 for depth, p0.05). Depth measurements were significantly smaller by MR-A (mean difference -1.1 mm, p<0.001). There was no bias between the different modalities. Conclusions Ex vivo FPCT-A and MR-A both deliver high diagnostic accuracy for the evaluation of osteochondral defects. FPCT-A was slightly more accurate than MR-A, which was most significant when measuring lesion depth.},

abstract={PurposeTo determine whether childhood intermittent exotropia (IXT) affects distance divergence and performance in block-building tasks within a virtual reality (VR) environment.MethodsThirty-nine children with IXT, aged 6–12 years, who underwent muscle surgery and 37 normal controls were enrolled. Children were instructed to watch the target moving away and perform a block-building task while fitted with a VR head-mounted display equipped with eye- and hand-movement tracking systems. The change in inter-ocular distance with binocular distance viewing, time to stack five cube blocks of different sizes in order, and distance disparities between the largest and farthest cubes were assessed. All children were evaluated at baseline and 3-month time points.ResultsThe patients with IXT exhibited a larger distance divergence than did controls (p = 0.024), which was associated with greater distance angle of deviation and poorer distance control (r = 0.350, p = 0.001 and r = 0.349, p = 0.004). At baseline, the patients with IXT showed larger distance disparities in the block-building task than did controls in terms of the horizontal, vertical, and 3-dimensional (3-D) measurements (all ps < 0.050). Larger horizontal disparity was associated with greater distance angle of deviation (r = 0.383, p = 0.037). Three months after surgery, the horizontal and 3-D disparities in the patients with IXT improved significantly and were not comparably different compared with controls.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that VR-based block-building task may be useful in testing possible deficits in visuo-motor skills associated with childhood IXT.},

abstract={PurposeTo validate an MR‐compatible version of the ScandiDos Delta4 Phantom+ on a 0.35T MR guided linear accelerator (MR‐Linac) system and to determine the effect of plan complexity on the measurement results.Methods/Materials36 clinical treatment plans originally delivered on a 0.35T MR linac system were re‐planned on the Delta4 Phantom+ MR geometry following our clinical quality assurance (QA) protocol. The QA plans were then measured using the Delta4 Phantom+ MR and the global gamma pass rates were compared to previous results measured using a Sun Nuclear ArcCHECK‐MR. Both 3%/3mm and 2%/2mm global gamma pass rates with a 20% dose threshold were recorded and compared. Plan complexity was quantified for each clinical plan investigated using 24 different plan metrics and each metric’s correlation with the overall 2%/2mm global gamma pass rate was investigated using Pearson correlation coefficients.ResultsBoth systems demonstrated comparable levels of gamma pass rates at both the 3%/3mm and 2%/2mm level for all plan complexity metrics. Nine plan metrics including area, number of active MLCs, perimeter, edge metric, leaf segment variability, complete irradiation area outline, irregularity, leaf travel index, and unique opening index were moderately (|r| > 0.5) correlated with the Delta4 2%/2mm global gamma pass rates whereas those same metrics had weak correlation with the ArcCHECK‐MR pass rates. Only the perimeter to area ratio and small aperture score (20 mm) metrics showed moderate correlation with the ArcCHECK‐MR gamma pass rates.ConclusionsThe MR‐compatible version of the ScandiDos Delta4 Phantom+ MR has been validated for clinical use on a 0.35T MR‐Linac with results being comparable to an ArcCHECK‐MR system in use clinically for almost five years. Most plan complexity metrics did not correlate with lower 2%/2mm gamma pass rates using the ArcCHECK‐MR but several metrics were found to be moderately correlated with lower 2%/2mm global gamma pass rates for the Delta4 Phantom+ MR.},

abstract={ObjectivesTo prospectively evaluate a 3D-multiecho-Dixon sequence with inline calculation of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* (qDixon), and an improved version of it (qDixon-WIP), for the MR-quantification of hepatic iron in a clinical setting.MethodsPatients with increased serum ferritin underwent 1.5-T MRI of the liver for the evaluation of hepatic iron overload. The imaging protocol for R2* quantification included as follows: (1) a validated, 2D multigradient-echo sequence (initial TE 0.99 ms, R2*-ME-GRE), (2) a 3D-multiecho-Dixon sequence with inline calculation of PDFF and R2* (initial TE 2.38 ms, R2*-qDixon), and optionally (3) a prototype (works-in-progress, WIP) version of the latter (initial TE 1.04 ms, R2*-qDixon-WIP) with improved water/fat separation and noise-corrected parameter fitting. For all sequences, three manually co-registered regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the liver. R2* values were compared and linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots calculated.ResultsForty-six out of 415 patients showed fat-water (F/W) swap with qDixon and were excluded. A total of 369 patients (mean age 52 years) were included; in 203/369, the optional qDixon-WIP was acquired, which showed no F/W swaps. A strong correlation was found between R2*-ME-GRE and R2*-qDixon (r2 = 0.92, p < 0.001) with Bland-Altman revealing a mean difference of − 3.82 1/s (SD = 21.26 1/s). Correlation between R2*-GRE-ME and R2*-qDixon-WIP was r2 = 0.95 (p < 0.001) with Bland-Altman showing a mean difference of − 0.125 1/s (SD = 30.667 1/s).ConclusionsThe 3D-multiecho-Dixon sequence is a reliable tool to quantify hepatic iron. Results are comparable with established relaxometry methods. Improvements to the original implementation eliminate occasional F/W swaps and limitations regarding maximum R2* values.Key Points• The 3D-multiecho-Dixon sequence for 1.5 T is a reliable tool to quantify hepatic iron.• Results of the 3D-multiecho-Dixon sequence are comparable with established relaxometry methods.• An improved version of the 3D-multiecho-Dixon sequence eliminates minor drawbacks.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) provides the potential for immersive and engaging training solutions for improving sport performance. However, if VR training is to be adopted and used in an effective and evidence-based fashion, a more rigorous assessment of the validity of the simulation is required. Construct validity is the degree to which the simulation provides an accurate representation of core features of the task. In the context of sport, if the training drills in the VR environment are a true representation of the skills needed in the real world, then those that excel at the sport in the real world should also excel in the virtual one. In this experiment, we examined the construct validity of a soccer-specific VR simulator by recruiting professional, academy, and novice players. Seventeen participants in each group completed four VR soccer drills, and the VR software provided scores relating to performance and process (e.g., passing accuracy, composure, reaction time, and adaptability). Based on these scores, an algorithm gave a diagnostic score relating to the predicted ability of the player. Results showed that this VR platform successfully differentiated between participants of differing skill levels. These results provide some support for the construct validity of this VR simulator and suggest at least partial overlap between the perceptual-cognitive and motor skills needed to perform well across ‘real’ and virtual environments. Further work is needed to explore the validity and fidelity of the simulation before its adoption as a training device can be fully endorsed.},

abstract={Gait training in a virtual reality (VR) environment is promising for children affected by different disorders. However, the efficacy of VR therapy is still under debate, and more research is needed to clarify its effects on clinical conditions. The combination of VR with neuroimaging methods, such as the electroencephalography (EEG), might help in answering this need. The aim of the present work was to set up and test a system for the multimodal analysis of the gait pattern during VR gait training of pediatric populations by analyzing the EEG correlates as well as the kinematic and kinetic parameters of the gait. An EEG system was integrated with the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab (GRAIL). We developed and validated, with healthy adults (n = 5) and children (n = 4, healthy or affected by cerebral palsy (CP)), the hardware and software integration of the two systems, which allowed the synchronization of the acquired signals and a reliable identification of the initial contact (IC) of each gait cycle, showing good sensitivity and critical success index values. Moreover, we tested the multimodal acquisition by successfully analyzing EEG data and kinematic and kinetic parameters of one healthy child and one child with CP. This system gives the possibility of monitoring the effect of the VR therapy and studying the neural correlates of gait.},

abstract={The concept of predictive and preventive maintenance and constant monitoring of the technical condition of industrial machinery is currently being greatly improved by the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms in particular. The advancement of such methods can vastly improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of systems designed for wear analysis and detection of vibrations that can indicate changes in the physical structure of the industrial components such as bearings, motor shafts, and housing, as well as other parts involved in rotary movement. Recently this concept was also adapted to the field of renewable energy and the automotive industry. The core of the presented prototype is an innovative interface interconnected with augmented reality (AR). The proposed integration of AR goggles allowed for constructing a platform that could acquire data used in rotary components technical evaluation and that could enable direct interaction with the user. The presented platform allows for the utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze vibrations generated by the rotary drive system to determine the technical condition of a wind turbine model monitored by an image processing system that measures frequencies generated by the machine.},

To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, the present researchers developed it into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). The current study examined the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 30). In addition to the aggression replacement training, patients played either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Aggressive behavior was measured pre-, half-way, and post-treatment via self-report and clinicians ratings. No difference was found between the VR-GAIME and the control game. However, the participants reported gaining more insight into their own behavior and that of others. Future VR intervention tools in clinical settings may capitalize more on their benefits for self-reflection within interpersonal settings.},

The results indicated that: (1) the learning effect of the field-independent learners was lower than that of the field-dependent learners in the real testing environment, but significantly higher than that of the field-dependent learners in the virtual testing environment. Meanwhile, there was a more significant difference in the real and virtual learning effect between the field-dependent and field-independent learners; (2) there was a significant interaction between cognitive style and test environment in the learners’ learning effect. Besides, cognitive style and test environment had an influence on the spoken English learning effect based on VR.

abstract={Student life causes many sources of stress due to the requirements of managing schoolwork, family, friends, health and wellbeing, and future career planning. Some students are overwhelmed and lack resilience to overcome stress, especially if they are inexperienced in managing setbacks, fail to achieve expectations, or lack skills to independently manage social skills, recreation, and study time. The long-term accumulation of stress has a negative impact on students’ physical and mental health, and may lead to a range of symptoms such as depression, anxiety, headache, insomnia, and eating disorders. Although most universities provide psychological counseling services, there is often a shortage of professional psychologists, which leads to students suffering from stress for longer than necessary without immediate assistance. The build-up of stress can lead to tragic consequences including abnormal reasoning, anti-social behavior, and suicide. There should never be a need for a student to wait more than a month to make an appointment for counseling services and every request for help should be immediately addressed and assessed. In this research, we designed a unique test platform for an immersive virtual reality group chatbot counseling system so students can receive psychological help and stress management counseling anytime and anywhere. First, the research used questionnaires to measure the stress levels and identifies how stress affects their lives. An immersive virtual reality chatbot was developed using professional psychological counseling knowledge that can provide answers during individual or group counseling sessions. Students can log in to the platform as avatars and ask the chatbot questions or interact with other students on the platform. This research provides college students with a new technology-based counseling environment designed to help relieve stress and learn new ways to improve student life quality from others. The platform provides a test base for future clinical trials to evaluate and improve the automated virtual reality chatbot counseling system.},

abstract={Animals make decisions under the principle of reward value maximization and surprise minimization. It is still unclear how these principles are represented in the brain and are reflected in behavior. We addressed this question using a closed-loop virtual reality system to train adult zebrafish for active avoidance. Analysis of the neural activity of the dorsal pallium during training revealed neural ensembles assigning rules to the colors of the surrounding walls. Additionally, one third of fish generated another ensemble that becomes activated only when the real perceived scenery shows discrepancy from the predicted favorable scenery. The fish with the latter ensemble escape more efficiently than the fish with the former ensembles alone, even though both fish have successfully learned to escape, consistent with the hypothesis that the latter ensemble guides zebrafish to take action to minimize this prediction error. Our results suggest that zebrafish can use both principles of goal-directed behavior, but with different behavioral consequences depending on the repertoire of the adopted principles.Using a closed-loop virtual reality system for fish, the authors show that zebrafish are capable of assigning rules to the scenery they see, and of generating a state prediction error by comparing reality with a prediction derived from an internal model.},

abstract={Objective. To explore the construction of immersive learning system based on virtual reality (VR) and test its learning effect. Methods. 20 qualified subjects were divided into two groups, each tending to agree, each with 5 boys and 5 girls. Experimental group 1 is in the real operating environment, and experimental group 2 is in the VR virtual disassembly experimental environment. The task process errors, knowledge questionnaire scores and user subjective satisfaction were analyzed statistically. Results. The significance probability P of knowledge questionnaire in the Levene test was 0.777, greater than 0.05, and the variance homogeneous, so the final P of independent sample t-test was subject to “assumed variance equal”; the significance probability was 0.613, greater than 0.05; the questionnaire scores of two groups showed no significant difference, so VR virtual environment can achieve the learning effect of the real environment. The number of errors in a VR virtual situation is significantly lower than the number of errors in the real environment, the VR virtual environment can achieve the learning effect of the real environment, and the VR virtual environment can achieve more interaction, with good interaction. Conclusion. The immersive learning system based on VR detection technology can realize the cognition of three-dimensional model structure and has a certain learning effect.},

abstract={Simple SummaryIn soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients, the decision for the optimal treatment modality largely depends on STS size, location, and a pathological measure that assesses tumor aggressiveness called “tumor grading”. To determine tumor grading, invasive biopsies are needed before therapy. In previous research studies, quantitative imaging features (“radiomics”) have been associated with tumor grading. In this work, we assessed the possibility of predicting tumor grading using an artificial intelligence technique called “deep learning” or “convolutional neural networks”. By analyzing either T1-weighted or T2-weighted MRI sequences, non-invasive tumor grading prediction was possible in an independent test patient cohort. The results were comparable to previous research work obtained with radiomics; however, the reproducibility of the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence was improved. The T2-based model was also able to significantly identify patients with a high risk for death after therapy.AbstractBackground: In patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, tumor grading constitutes a decisive factor to determine the best treatment decision. Tumor grading is obtained by pathological work-up after focal biopsies. Deep learning (DL)-based imaging analysis may pose an alternative way to characterize STS tissue. In this work, we sought to non-invasively differentiate tumor grading into low-grade (G1) and high-grade (G2/G3) STS using DL techniques based on MR-imaging. Methods: Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated (T1FSGd) MRI sequences and fat-saturated T2-weighted (T2FS) sequences were collected from two independent retrospective cohorts (training: 148 patients, testing: 158 patients). Tumor grading was determined following the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group in pre-therapeutic biopsies. DL models were developed using transfer learning based on the DenseNet 161 architecture. Results: The T1FSGd and T2FS-based DL models achieved area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.75 and 0.76 on the test cohort, respectively. T1FSGd achieved the best F1-score of all models (0.90). The T2FS-based DL model was able to significantly risk-stratify for overall survival. Attention maps revealed relevant features within the tumor volume and in border regions. Conclusions: MRI-based DL models are capable of predicting tumor grading with good reproducibility in external validation.},

abstract={Background Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a condition characterized by chronic subjective dizziness and exacerbated by visual stimuli or upright movement. Typical balance tests do not replicate the environments known to increase symptoms in people with PPPD—crowded places with moving objects. Using a virtual reality system, we quantified dynamic balance in people with PPPD and healthy controls in diverse visual conditions. Methods Twenty-two individuals with PPPD and 29 controls performed a square-shaped fast walking task (Four-Square Step Test Virtual Reality—FSST-VR) using a head-mounted-display (HTC Vive) under 3 visual conditions (empty train platform; people moving; people and trains moving). Head kinematics was used to measure task duration, movement smoothness and anterior–posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) ranges of movement (ROM). Heart rate (HR) was monitored using a chest-band. Participants also completed a functional mobility test (Timed-Up-and-Go; TUG) and questionnaires measuring anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI), balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence; ABC), perceived disability (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) and simulator sickness (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). Main effects of visual load and group and associations between performance, functional and self-reported outcomes were examined. Results State anxiety and simulator sickness did not increase following testing. AP-ROM and HR increased with high visual load in both groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in head kinematics. In the high visual load conditions, high trait anxiety and longer TUG duration were moderately associated with reduced AP and ML-ROM in the PPPD group and low ABC and high perceived disability were associated with reduced AP-ROM (|r| =  0.47 to 0.53; p < 0.05). In contrast, in controls high STAI-trait, low ABC and longer TUG duration were associated with increased AP-ROM (|r| = 0.38 to 0.46; p < 0.05) and longer TUG duration was associated with increased ML-ROM (r = 0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusions FSST-VR may shed light on movement strategies in PPPD beyond task duration. While no main effect of group was observed, the distinct associations with self-reported and functional outcomes, identified using spatial head kinematics, suggest that some people with PPPD reduce head degrees of freedom when performing a dynamic balance task. This supports a potential link between spatial perception and PPPD symptomatology.},

abstract={Purpose: To test the ability of a virtual reality (VR) orientation and mobility (O&M) protocol to serve a measure of functional vision for patients with inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). Methods: A VR-O&M protocol designed using a commercially available VR hardware was tested in normally sighted control subjects (n=7; ages 10– 35yo; Average 22.5yo) and patients with RPE65-associated Leber Congenital Amaurosis (n=3; ages 7– 18yo; Average 12.7yo), in two of them before and after gene therapy. Patients underwent perimetry and full-field sensitivity testing. VR-O&M parameters correlated with the visual dysfunction. Results: Visual acuities in RPE65 patients were on average worse than 20/200, dark-adapted sensitivity losses > 5 log units, and fields constricted between 20° and 40°. Before treatment, patients required ∼ 1000-fold brighter environment to navigate, had at least x4 more collisions, and were slower both to orient and navigate compared to control subjects. Improvements in cone- (by 1– 2 L.u.) and rod-mediated (by > 4 L.u.) sensitivities post-treatment led to fewer collisions (at least by half) at ∼ 100-fold dimmer luminances, and to x4 times faster navigation times. Conclusion: This study provides proof-of-concept data in support for the use of VR-O&M systems to quantify the impact that the visual dysfunction and improvement of vision following treatments has on functional vision in IRDs. The VR-O&M was useful in potentially challenging scenarios such as in pediatric patients with severe IRDs. Translational Relevance: A VR-O&M test will provide much needed flexibility, both in its deployment as well as in the possibility to test various attributes of vision that may be impacted by gene therapy in the setting of translational studies. Precis: This study provides proof-of-concept data in support for the use of a virtual reality orientation and mobility test to quantify the impact of the disease and of treatments thereof on functional vision in inherited retinal degenerations.},

abstract={Background We previously proposed a novel virtual reality-based method to assess human field of perception (FOP) and field of regard (FOR), termed the FOPR test. This study assessed the diagnostic validity of the FOPR test for hemispatial neglect (HSN). Methods We included 19 stroke patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere and with HSN (HSN+SS), 22 stroke patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere and without HSN (HSN−SS), and 22 healthy controls aged 19–65 years. The success rate (SR) and response time (RT) in the FOPR test for both FOP and FOR were assessed (FOP-SR, FOR-SR, FOP-RT, and FOR-RT, respectively). Using a Bland–Altman plot, agreements between the FOPR test and conventional tests were confirmed, and the FOPR test accuracy was verified using the support vector machine (SVM). Measured values were analysed using ANOVA and Kruskall–Wallis tests for group comparison. Results The Bland–Altman plot showed good agreement between FOPR test and conventional tests; individuals within 95% agreement limits were within the range of 94.8–100.0%. The SVM classification accuracy, using FOP and FOR variables from the left hemispace, ranged from 83.3 to 100.0% in a binary classification (HSN vs non-HSN). The FOPR test demonstrated differences in SR and RT for both FOP and FOR across the groups. Conclusion The FOPR test was valid for the HSN diagnosis and provided quantitative and intuitive information regarding visuospatial function. Furthermore, it might enhance our understanding of visuospatial function including HSN by applying the time relative component and concepts of perception and exploration, FOP and FOR. Trial registration: NCT03463122. Registered 13 March 2018, retrospectively registered.},

abstract={Background: The Equitest system (Neurocom) is a computerized dynamic posturography device used by health care providers and clinical researchers to safely test an individual’s postural control. While the Equitest system has evaluative and rehabilitative value, it may be limited owing to its cost, lack of portability, and reliance on only sagittal plane movements. Virtual reality (VR) provides an opportunity to reduce these limitations by providing more mobile and cost-effective tools while also observing a wider array of postural characteristics. Objective: This study aimed to test the plausibility of using VR as a feasible alternative to the Equitest system for conducting a sensory organization test. Methods: A convenience sample of 20 college-aged healthy individuals participated in the study. Participants completed the sensory organization test using the Equitest system as well as using a VR environment while standing atop a force plate (Bertec Inc). The Equitest system measures the equilibrium index. During VR trials, the estimated equilibrium index, 95% ellipse area, path length, and anterior-posterior detrended fluctuation analysis scaling exponent alpha were calculated from center of pressure data. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between the equilibrium index and center of pressure–derived balance measures. Intraclass correlations for absolute agreement and consistency were calculated to compare the equilibrium index and estimated equilibrium index. Results: Intraclass correlations demonstrated moderate consistency and absolute agreement (0.5 < intraclass correlation coefficient < 0.75) between the equilibrium index and estimated equilibrium index from the Equitest and VR sensory organization test (SOT), respectively, in four of six tested conditions. Additionally, weak to moderate correlations between force plate measurements and the equilibrium index were noted in several of the conditions. Conclusions: This research demonstrated the plausibility of using VR as an alternative method to conduct the SOT. Ongoing development and testing of virtual environments are necessary before employing the technology as a replacement to current clinical tests.},

abstract={Breathing exercises with biofeedback have benefits over breathing exercises without biofeedback. However, the traditional measurement of respiratory signals that is required as part of feeding back the breath incurs high cost and effort. We propose a novel virtual reality (VR) based approach to respiratory biofeedback that utilizes the positionally tracked hand controllers integrated into modern VR systems to capture and feedback the respiration-induced abdominal movements. In a randomized controlled laboratory study, we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of the developed biofeedback algorithm. In total, 72 participants performed a short breathing exercise in VR with or without respiratory biofeedback. The feedback integration resulted in a satisfactory user experience, a heightened breath awareness, a greater focus on slow diaphragmatic breathing and an increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This evidences that the novel biofeedback approach is low-cost, unobtrusive, usable and effective in increasing breath awareness and promoting slow diaphragmatic breathing in the context of VR-based breathing exercises. Future studies need to investigate the broader applicability and long-term effects.},

abstract={Previous research indicates that the size of the own body affects the judgment of objects’ size, depending on the amount of subjective ownership toward the body (Van der Hoort et al. in PLOS ONE 6(5):e20195, 2011). We are the first to transfer this own-body-size effect into a virtual environment. In a series of three experiments, participants (N = 68) had to embody small, medium, and large avatars and judge the size of objects. Body ownership was manipulated using synchronous and asynchronous touch. We also included a new paradigm with an additional change of perspective to induce stronger ownership (Experiment 2). Additionally, we assessed whether the visibility of the body during the judgment phase influenced the results (Experiment 3). In all three experiments, we found an overestimation in a small and an underestimation in a large body compared to a medium body. However, size estimation did not depend on the degree of ownership despite clear differences in self-reported ownership. Our results show that a virtual reality scenario does not require a visuotactile manipulation of ownership in order to evoke the own-body-size effect. Our validation of the effect in a virtual setting may be helpful for the design of clinical applications.},

abstract={Background: Digital rectal examination is a difficult examination to learn and teach because of limited opportunities for practice; however, the main challenge is that students and tutors cannot see the finger when it is palpating the anal canal and prostate gland inside the patients. Objective: This paper presents an augmented reality system to be used with benchtop models commonly available in medical schools with the aim of addressing the problem of lack of visualization. The system enables visualization of the examining finger, as well as of the internal organs when performing digital rectal examinations. Magnetic tracking sensors are used to track the movement of the finger, and a pressure sensor is used to monitor the applied pressure. By overlaying a virtual finger on the real finger and a virtual model on the benchtop model, students can see through the examination and finger maneuvers. Methods: The system was implemented in the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies) and uses a first-generation HoloLens (Microsoft Inc) as an augmented reality device. To evaluate the system, 19 participants (9 clinicians who routinely performed digital rectal examinations and 10 medical students) were asked to use the system and answer 12 questions regarding the usefulness of the system. Results: The system showed the movement of an examining finger in real time with a frame rate of 60 fps on the HoloLens and accurately aligned the virtual and real models with a mean error of 3.9 mm. Users found the movement of the finger was realistic (mean 3.9, SD 1.2); moreover, they found the visualization of the finger and internal organs were useful for teaching, learning, and assessment of digital rectal examinations (finger: mean 4.1, SD 1.1; organs: mean 4.6, SD 0.8), mainly targeting a novice group. Conclusions: The proposed augmented reality system was designed to improve teaching and learning of digital rectal examination skills by providing visualization of the finger and internal organs. The initial user study proved its applicability and usefulness.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was (1) to implement a test for binocular imbalance in a Virtual Reality headset, (2) to assess its testability, reliability and outcomes in a population of clinical patients and (3) to evaluate the relationships of interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and binocular imbalance to amblyogenic risk factors. 100 volunteers (6 to 70 years old, mean 21.2 ± 16.2), 21 with no amblyogenic risk factors and 79 with amblyopia or a history of amblyopia participated. Participants were classified by amblyogenic risk factor (24 anisometropic, 25 strabismic and 30 mixed) and, for those with strabismus, also by refractive response (16 accommodative and 39 non-accommodative). We characterized our sample using three variables, called the ‘triplet’ henceforth: interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and imbalance factor. Binocular imbalance showed high test-retest reliability (no significant difference between test and retest in a subgroup, n = 20, p = 0.831); was correlated with Worth 4 dots test (r = 0.538, p<0.0001); and correlated with both interocular acuity difference (r = 0.575, p<0.0001) and stereoacuity (r = 0.675, p<0.0001). The mean values of each variable of the triplet differed depending on group classification. Mixed and non-accommodative groups showed the worst mean values compared with the other groups. Among participants with strabismus, strabismic vs mixed subgroups did not show significant differences in any variable of the triplet, whereas the accommodative vs non-accommodative subgroups showed significant differences in all of them. According to a univariate logistic model, any variable of the triplet provides a good metric for differentiating patients from controls, except for binocular imbalance for anisometropic subgroup. The proposed binocular imbalance test is feasible and reliable. We recommend monitoring amblyopia clinically not only considering visual acuity, but also stereoacuity and interocular imbalance. Stereoacuity on its own fails because of the high percentage of patients with no measurable stereoacuity. Binocular imbalance may help to fill that gap.},

abstract={Today, falls constitute a substantial health problem, especially in the elderly, and the diagnostic tests used by clinicians present often a low sensitivity and specificity. This is the case for the Timed Up and Go test which lacks contextualization with regard to everyday life limiting the relevance of its diagnosis. Virtual reality enables the creation of immersive, reproducible and secure environments, close to situations encountered in daily life, and as such could improve falling risk assessment. This study aims to evaluate the effect of immersive virtual reality by wearing a virtual reality headset with a non-disturbing virtual environment compared to real world on the Timed Up and Go test completion. Thirty-one elders (73.7 ± 9 years old) volunteered to participate in the study and the mean times and number of steps to complete a Timed Up and Go were compared in two conditions: actual-world clinical and virtual reality conditions. The results showed that the mean completion times and most of the mean number of steps of the Timed Up and Go in virtual reality condition were significantly different to those in clinical condition. These results suggest that there is a virtual reality effect and this effect is significantly correlated to the time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go. This information will be of interest to quantify the potential part of virtual reality effect on the motor control, measured in a virtual task using virtual controlled disturbances.},

abstract={The purpose of this experimental study is to validate linear and angular measurements acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment via a comparison with the physical measurements. The hypotheses tested are as follows: VR linear and angular measurements (1) are equivalent to the corresponding physical measurements and (2) achieve a high degree of reproducibility. Both virtual and physical measurements were performed by two raters in four different sessions. A total of 40 linear and 15 angular measurements were acquired from three physical objects (an L-block, a hand model, and a dry skull) via the use of fiducial markers on selected locations. After both intra- and inter-rater reliability were evaluated using inter-class coefficient (ICC), equivalence between virtual and physical measurements was analyzed via paired t test and Bland-Altman plots. The accuracy of the virtual measurements was further estimated using two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure. The reproducibility of virtual measurements was evaluated via ICC as well as the repeatability coefficient. Virtual reality measurements were equivalent to physical measurements as evidenced by a paired t test with p values of 0.413 for linear and 0.533 for angular measurements and Bland-Altman plots in all three objects. The accuracy of virtual measurements was estimated to be 0.5 mm for linear and 0.7° for angular measurements, respectively. Reproducibility in VR measurements was high as evidenced by ICC of 1.00 for linear and 0.99 for angular measurements, respectively. Both linear and angular measurements in the VR environment are equivalent to the physical measurements with high accuracy and reproducibility.},

abstract={This manuscript analyzes the influence of display parameters and display devices over the spatial skills of the users in virtual reality environments. For this, the authors of this manuscript developed a virtual reality application which tests the spatial skills of the users. 240 students used an LG desktop display and 61 students used the Gear VR for the tests. Statistical data are generated when the users do the tests and the following factors are logged by the application and evaluated in this manuscript: virtual camera type, virtual camera field of view, virtual camera rotation, contrast ratio parameters, the existence of shadows and the device used. The probabilities of correct answers were analyzed based on these factors by logistic regression (logit) analysis method. The influences and interactions of all factors were analyzed. The perspective camera, lighter contrast ratio, no or large camera rotations and the use of the Gear VR greatly and positively influenced the probability of correct answers on the tests. Therefore, for the assessment of spatial ability in virtual reality, the use of these parameters and device present the optimal user-centric human–computer interaction practice.},

abstract={Objective: The aims of the present study were twofold: 1) to examine the effects of a virtual reality version of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR) using a placebo as the control condition; 2) to delineate sex differences in psychophysiological responses following the TSST-VR. Methods: Healthy young male (n = 30) and female (n = 30) undergraduates were randomly assigned to a psychosocial stress protocol condition or to a non-stressful control condition (placebo) also under virtual reality environment (VR). Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured throughout the condition. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the perceived stress before and after the condition. We also included subjective scales of emotional states and coping. Results: Different ANOVAs showed that after VR, the stress group reported higher scores on VAS than the non-stress group. Before VR, compared with females, the males showed stronger EDA and higher HRV. Under VR, the males had lower HR. After VR, the males’ HR was still lower than females’, but their HRV was higher than females’. Finally, the correlation between subjective and objective reactivity demonstrated that HRV during the experiment was negatively correlated to depression and negative affect. The HRV after VR was negatively correlated to the positive coping but was positively correlated to the depression. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the TSST-VR could be used as an available tool for testing sex differences to psychosocial stress induction in experimental settings. Compared with females, males were more sensitive to stress. The scores on depression, negative affect and positive coping before the stress induction may be able to predict the arousal of the sympathetic nervous system across the stress situations.},

abstract={Clinical science and medical imaging technology are traditionally displayed in two dimensions (2D) on a computer monitor. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) expands the realm of 2D image visualization, enabling an immersive VR experience with unhindered spatial interaction by the user. Thus far, analysis of data extracted from VR applications was mainly qualitative. In this study, we enhance VR and provide evidence for quantitative VR research by validating digital VR display of computed tomography (CT) data of the orbit. Volumetric CT data were transferred and rendered into a VR environment. Subsequently, seven graders performed repeated and blinded diameter measurements. The intergrader variability of the measurements in VR was much lower compared to measurements in the physical world and measurements were reasonably consistent with their corresponding elements in the real context. The overall VR measurements were 5.49% higher. As such, this study attests the ability of VR to provide similar quantitative data alongside the added benefit of VR interfaces. VR entails a lot of potential for the future research in ophthalmology and beyond in any scientific field that uses three-dimensional data.},

abstract={Microwave remote sensing is the most promising tool for monitoring near-surface soil moisture distributions globally. With the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions in orbit, considerable efforts are being made to evaluate derived soil moisture products via ground observations, microwave transfer simulation, and independent remote sensing retrievals. Due to the large footprint of the satellite radiometers of about 40 km in diameter and the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture, minimum sampling densities for soil moisture are required to challenge the targeted precision. Here we use 400 m resolution simulations with the regional Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) and its coupling with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM) to quantify the maximum sampling distance allowed for soil moisture and brightness temperature validation. Our analysis suggests that an overall sampling distance of finer than 6 km is required to validate the targeted accuracy of 0.04 cm3 cm-3 with a 70 % confidence level in SMOS and SMAP estimates over typical mid-latitude European regions. The maximum allowed sampling distance depends on the land-surface heterogeneity and the meteorological situation, which influences the soil moisture patterns, and ranges from about 6 to 17 km for a 70 % confidence level for a typical year. At the maximum allowed sampling distance on a 70 % confidence level, the accuracy of footprint-averaged soil moisture is equal to or better than brightness temperature estimates over the same area. Estimates strongly deteriorate with larger sampling distances. For the evaluation of the smaller footprints of the active and active–passive products of SMAP the required sampling densities increase; e.g., when a grid resolution of 3 km diameter is sampled by three sites of footprints of 9 km sampled by five sites required, only 50 %–60 % of the pixels have a sampling error below the nominal values. The required minimum sampling densities for ground-based radiometer networks to estimate footprint-averaged brightness temperature are higher than for soil moisture due to the non-linearities of radiative transfer, and only weakly correlated in space and time. This study provides a basis for a better understanding of the sometimes strong mismatches between derived satellite soil moisture products and ground-based measurements.},

abstract={Paranoia may build on negative beliefs held both about the self and others. Compassionate imagery may be one way of reducing such negative beliefs, and hence paranoia. Two studies tested this idea, one targeting compassion for the self and one targeting compassion for others. Two-hundred individuals from the general population scoring highly for paranoia were recruited. The studies used a randomised controlled experimental design, with embedded tests for mediation. Study one targeted self-compassion via creation of a compassionate coach (CC) image. Study two targeted compassion for others via loving kindness meditation (LKM). Individuals repeatedly entered neutral virtual reality social environments. Changes in compassion and paranoia were assessed. Compared to controls, the CC group increased in self-compassion (group difference = 2.12, C.I. = 1.57;2.67, p = <0.0001, d = 1.4) and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.73, C.I. = −2.48; −0.98, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in self-compassion explained 57% of change in paranoia. Compared to controls, the LKM group increased their compassion for others (group difference = 3.26, C.I. = 2.72;3.80, p = <0.0001, d = 1.7), and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.70, C.I. = −2.50; −0.89, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in compassion for others explained 67% of change in paranoia. Targeting negative beliefs about the self and others using compassionate imagery causes reductions in paranoia.

abstract={The Diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) requires an exhaustive and objective assessment in order to design an intervention that is adapted to the peculiarities of the patients. The present study aimed to determine if the most commonly used ADHD observation scale—the Evaluation of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity (EDAH) scale—is able to predict performance in a Continuous Performance Test based on Virtual Reality (VR-CPT). One-hundred-and-fifty students (76% boys and 24% girls) aged 6–16 (M = 10.35; DT = 2.39) participated in the study. Regression analyses showed that only the EDAH subscale referring to inattention symptoms, was a statistically significant predictor of performance in a VR-CPT. More specifically, this subscale showed 86.5% prediction-accuracy regarding performance in the Omissions variable, 80.4% in the Commissions variable, and 74.5% in the Response-time variable. The EDAH subscales referring to impulsivity and hyperactivity were not statistically significant predictors of any variables in the VR-CPT. Our findings may partially explain why impulsive-hyperactive and the combined presentations of ADHD might be considered as unique and qualitatively different sub-categories of ADHD. These results also highlighted the importance of measuring not only the observable behaviors of ADHD individuals, but also the scores in performance tests that are attained by the patients themselves.},

abstract={The present endeavor investigates the controlled surface modifications and evolution of self-assembled nano-dimensional defects on oblique Ar+ sputtered Si(111) surfaces which are important substrates for surface reconstruction. The defect formation started at off-normal incidences of 50° and then deflates into defined defect zones with decrease in oblique incidence, depending strongly on angle of ion incidence. Interestingly, it is observed that mean size & height decreases while average density of these defects increases with decreasing oblique incidence. Non-linear response of roughness of irradiated Si(111) with respect to oblique incidence is observed. Crystalline (c-Si) to amorphous (a-Si) phase transition under oblique argon ion irradiation has been revealed by Raman spectroscopy. Our analysis, thus, shows that high dose argon ion irradiation generates of self-assembled nano-scale defects and surface vacancies & their possible clustering into extended defect zones. Explicitly, ion beam-stimulated mass transport inside the amorphous layers governs the observed defect evolution. This investigation of crystalline (c-Si) coupled with amorphous (a-Si) phases of nano-structured surfaces provides insight into the potential applications in the nano-electronic and optoelectronic devices thus, initiating a new era for fabricating multitude of novel structures.},

abstract={Computerized continuous performance tests (CPTs) are commonly used to characterize attention in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Virtual classroom CPTs, designed to enhance ecological validity, are increasingly being utilized. Lacking is a quantitative meta-analysis of clinical comparisons of attention performance in children with ADHD using virtual classroom CPTs. The objective of the present systematic PRISMA review was to address this empirical void and compare three-dimensional (3D) virtual classroom CPTs to traditional two-dimensional (2D) CPTs. The peer-reviewed literature on comparisons of virtual classroom performance between children with ADHD and typically developing children was explored in six databases (e.g., Medline). Published studies using a virtual classroom to compare attentional performance between children with ADHD and typically developing children were included. Given the high heterogeneity with modality comparisons (i.e., computerized CPTs vs. virtual classroom CPTs for ADHD), both main comparisons included only population comparisons (i.e., control vs. ADHD) using each CPT modality. Meta-analytic findings were generally consistent with previous meta-analyses of computerized CPTs regarding the commonly used omission, commission, and hit reaction time variables. Results suggest that the virtual classroom CPTs reliably differentiate attention performance in persons with ADHD. Ecological validity implications are discussed pertaining to subtle meta-analytic outcome differences compared to computerized 2D CPTs. Further, due to an inability to conduct moderator analyses, it remains unclear if modality differences are due to other factors. Suggestions for future research using the virtual classroom CPTs are provided.},

abstract={Negative thoughts are experienced by as many as 80–99% of the population. These thoughts are associated with a variety of negative consequences, including negative mood, decreased task performance and the development of psychopathology. One technique employed in contextual behavioral therapies to help cope with negative thoughts is cognitive defusion. Cognitive defusion techniques undermine potential negative effects of thinking by teaching clients to get some distance from their thoughts. Virtual reality (VR) is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that users can interact in. VR is of increasing interest to applied psychologists due to its potential for exposure learning. One area where VR may be effective is helping people to cope with negative thoughts. The current study examined the impact of a VR task as a cognitive defusion technique on participants’ relationship with a negative self-referential thought (e.g., “I am a failure”). Thirty participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (i.e., defusion VR and control VR). Participants were tested pre- and post-VR task on a state measure of cognitive defusion and ratings of their self-referential negative thought. The results indicated that a defusion VR task facilitates the management of negative thoughts and leads to an increase in state defusion. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the use of VR techniques in dealing with negative thoughts.},

abstract={With the development of autonomous driving technology, it is possible self-driving cleaning truck being driving and working automatically. However, a lot of field trials are timeconsuming and wasteful during the investigation of self-driving truck. In order to reduce lots of on-site and real vehicle tests, we construct a 3D virtual pilotless vehicle testing system for the cleaning truck based on virtual reality technology. 3DMax software is used to build virtual 3D scene static model and cleaning truck model. The established static models are imported into Unity3D to simulate different 3D scenes during cleaning truck self-driving. We designed a UI interface to build a virtual testing system of self-driving cleaning truck which is easy to realize human-computer interaction. we have achieved successfully the avoidance of obstacles and round-the-island driving. And we have successfully completed the identification of traffic lights and the pilotless driving test on crossroad virtual scene. In the virtual testing system, we can quickly experience the virtual testing scenes of the self-driving cleaning truck in various scenarios and get some kinematics information. The virtual testing system can partly replace the field tests and provide methods and theoretical guidance for field test, which can shorten the development cycle and save money, and is also unrestricted and repeatable. At the same time, the researching results provide new ideas and methods for the investigation of vehicle tests and pilotless driving.},

Although social stories in a form of virtual reality program can help children with ASD, developing them and identifying appropriate responses might be subjective and thus challenging. Using Delphi method, and guided by general case training, we involved 63 parents and clinicians of individuals with ASD, in two rounds of online iteration to refine the stories. Scenarios that reached a 75% agreement level were accepted.

abstract={Despite the persistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) into adulthood and adolescence, there are few objective, reliable instruments (based on patient performance) that have been shown to be able to predict current and retrospective ADHD symptoms. The present study aimed to explore whether a validated VR test called Nesplora Aquarium is able to predict ADHD symptoms in adults and adolescents, based on both current and retrospective self-reports. A non-clinical sample of 156 adults and adolescents (70 women and 86 men) between 16 and 54 years of age (M = 21.23, SD = 8.04) took part in the study. Virtual reality (VR) variables such as the number of correct answers, omission and commission errors, among others, were used to predict current and retrospective self-reported symptoms of ADHD using multiple regression models. Correct answers and omission errors in the VR test significantly predicted both current and retrospective ADHD symptoms. However, only the number of perseveration errors and gender were able to significantly predict retrospective ADHD symptoms. These findings suggest that inattention problems tend to remain after adolescence, while perseveration errors (which have been related to impulsive behavior) and gender differences tend to diminish.},

abstract={Background: Compensatory movement, such as flexing the trunk during reaching, may negatively affect motor improvement during task-based practice for persons with stroke. Shaping, or incrementally decreasing, the amount of compensation used during rehabilitation may be a viable strategy with methods using virtual reality.Methods: A virtual reality tool was designed to (1) monitor upper extremity movement kinematics with an off-the-shelf motion sensor (Microsoft Kinect V2), (2) convert movements into control of widely available computer games, and (3) provide real-time feedback to shape trunk compensation. This system was tested for feasibility by a small cohort of participants with chronic stroke (n = 5) during a 1-h session involving 40 min of virtual reality interaction. Outcomes related to repetitions, compensation, movement kinematics, usability, motivation, and sense of presence were collected.Results: Participants achieved a very high dose of reaching repetitions (461 ± 184), with an average of 81% being successful and 19% involving compensatory trunk flexion. Participants rated the system as highly usable, motivating, engaging, and safe.Conclusions: VRShape is feasible to use as a tool for increasing repetition rates, measuring and shaping compensation, and enhancing motivation for upper extremity therapy. Future research should focus on software improvements and investigation of efficacy during a virtual reality-based motor intervention.},

abstract={Subjective visual vertical (SVV) assesses the ability to perceive verticality, which is a measure of vestibular otolithic function. Vestibular lesions influence this perception of verticality. We developed a method using virtual reality (VR) display and an Android software application named ‘Curator SVV’. The virtual reality SVV (Curator SVV) consisted of ten readily identifiable artworks projected by a Samsung phone S6 which is inserted into a virtual reality headset. In the first study, 20 patients had there SVV assessed with two devices: (1) a commercially available SVV measurement device (VestiTest®) and (2) a virtual reality SVV using the Curator SVV application. In a second study, 32 healthy subjects had their SVV assessed by the Curator SVV application whilst sitting in a chair. In the first study, there was no significant difference (p = 0.44, paired t test and p = 0.01, test of equivalence) between results obtained by Curator SVV and the commercially available device. In the second study, the average angle measured for healthy subjects was 0.00° ± 0.85°. The normal range (mean ± 2 SD) was ± 2° in standard upright position. We were able to demonstrate that the Curator SVV can be readily employed as an objective, non-invasive and affordable means of assessing otolith function in the clinical context. We validated this novel methodology by finding strong quantitative parity between a standard commercial SVV unit and the VR Curator SVV method. Our very lightweight and mobile device can be employed in clinical contexts including at the bedside and in different head and body positions.},

abstract={Objectives To validate MR textural analysis (MRTA) for detection of transition zone (TZ) prostate cancer through comparison with co-registered prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-MR. Methods Retrospective analysis was performed for 30 men who underwent simultaneous PSMA PET-MR imaging for staging of prostate cancer. Thirty texture features were derived from each manually contoured T2-weighted, transaxial, prostatic TZ using texture analysis software that applies a spatial band-pass filter and quantifies texture through histogram analysis. Texture features of the TZ were compared to PSMA expression on the corresponding PET images. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controlled the false discovery rate at <5%. Results Eighty-eight T2-weighted images in 18 patients demonstrated abnormal PSMA expression within the TZ on PET-MR. 123 images were PSMA negative. Based on the corrected p-value of 0.005, significant differences between PSMA positive and negative slices were found for 16 texture parameters: Standard deviation and mean of positive pixels for all spatial filters (p = <0.0001 for both at all spatial scaling factor (SSF) values) and mean intensity following filtration for SSF 3–6 mm (p = 0.0002–0.0018). Conclusion Abnormal expression of PSMA within the TZ is associated with altered texture on T2-weighted MR, providing validation of MRTA for the detection of TZ prostate cancer. Key Points • Prostate transition zone (TZ) MR texture analysis may assist in prostate cancer detection. • Abnormal transition zone PSMA expression correlates with altered texture on T2-weighted MR. • TZ with abnormal PSMA expression demonstrates significantly reduced MI, SD and MPP.},

abstract={IntroductionDissociated tests of strabismus provide valuable information for diagnosis and monitoring of ocular misalignment in patients with normal retinal correspondence. However, they are vulnerable to operator error and rely on a fixed head position.

The virtual reality headset-based programme consisted of an initial test to measure horizontal and vertical deviation, followed by a test for torsion.ResultsThe pattern of deviation obtained using the virtual reality-based test showed agreement with that obtained from the Lees screen for patients with a fourth nerve palsy, comitant esotropia, and restrictive thyroid eye disease.ConclusionsThis study reports the first use of a virtual reality headset in assessing ocular misalignment, and demonstrates that it is a feasible dissociative test of strabismus.},

abstract={Background. Prolonged exposure to moving images in virtual reality systems can cause virtual reality induced motion sickness (VIMS). The ability to resist motion sickness may be associated with the level of vestibular function development. objective. The aim of the present research is to study the oculomotor characteristics of individuals whose observation of moving virtual environments causes the VIMS effect. We hypothesized that people who have a robust vestibular function as a result of their professional activity, are less susceptible to VIMS than people who have no such professional abilities. The differences in people’s abilities to resist the effects of the virtual environment may be revealed in the oculomotor characteristics registered during their interaction with a virtual environment. Design. Figure skaters, football players, wushu fighters, and non-trained people were tested. e CAVE virtual reality system was used to initiate the VIMS effect. three virtual scenes were constructed consisting of many bright balls moving as a whole around the observer. e scenes differed in the width of the visual field; all balls subtended either 45°, 90° or 180°. Results. The results showed more active eye movements for athletes compared to non-trained people, i.e. an increase in blink, fixation, and saccade counts. A decrease in saccadic amplitudes was revealed for figure skaters. These characteristics were considered specific indicators of the athletes’ ability to resist motion sickness. Conclusions. It was found that the strength of the VIMS effect increased with the increasing width of the visual field. The effectiveness of virtual reality and eye-tracking technologies to test the VIMS effect was demonstrated.},

abstract={People mimic each other's actions and postures during everyday interactions. It is widely believed this mimicry acts as a social glue, leading to increased rapport. We present two studies using virtual reality to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Study 1, 50 participants interacted with two avatars who either mimicked their head and torso movements at a 1 or 3 second time delay or did not mimic, and rated feelings of rapport and trust toward the avatars. Rapport was higher towards mimicking avatars, with no effect of timing. In Study 2, we aimed to replicate this effect in a pre-registered design and test whether it is modulated by cultural ingroup-outgroup boundaries. Forty participants from European or East Asian backgrounds interacted with four avatars, two of European appearance and two of East Asian appearance. Two avatars mimicked while the other two did not. We found no effects of mimicry on rapport or trust ratings or implicit trust behaviour in a novel maze task, and no effects of group status or interactions. These null results were calculated in line with our pre-registration. We conclude that being mimicked does not always increase rapport or trust, and make suggestions for future directions.},

abstract={Background We propose a virtual reality (VR) model, reproducing a house environment, where color modification of target places, obtainable by home automation in a real ambient, was tested by means of a P3b paradigm. The target place (bathroom door) was designed to be recognized during a virtual wayfinding in a realistic reproduction of a house environment. Different color and luminous conditions, easily obtained in the real ambient from a remote home automation control, were applied to the target and standard places, all the doors being illuminated in white (W), and only target doors colored with a green (G) or red (R) spotlight. Three different Virtual Environments (VE) were depicted, as the bathroom was designed in the aisle (A), living room (L) and bedroom (B). EEG was recorded from 57 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy subjects in the 60-80 year age range (O--old group) and 12 normal cases in the 20-30 year age range (Y--young group). Results In Young group, all the target stimuli determined a significant increase in P3b amplitude on the parietal, occipital and central electrodes compared to frequent stimuli condition, whatever was the color of the target door, while in elderly group the P3b obtained by the green and red colors was significantly different from the frequent stimulus, on the parietal, occipital, and central derivations, while the White stimulus did not evoke a significantly larger P3b with respect to frequent stimulus. Discussion The modulation of P3b amplitude, obtained by color and luminance change of target place, suggests that cortical resources, able to compensate the age-related progressive loss of cognitive performance, need to be facilitated even in normal elderly. The event-related responses obtained by virtual reality may be a reliable method to test the environmental feasibility to age-related cognitive changes.},

abstract={The advent of neuroimaging in dental research provides exciting opportunities for relating excitation of trigeminal neurons to human somatosensory perceptions. Cold air sensitivity is one of the most frequent causes of dental discomfort or pain. Up to date, devices capable of delivering controlled cold air in an MR-environment are unavailable for quantitative sensory testing. This study therefore aimed at constructing and evaluating a novel MR-compatible, computer-controlled cold air stimulation apparatus (CASA) that produces graded air puffs. CASA consisted of a multi-injector air jet delivery system, a cold exchanger, a cooling agent and a stimulus application construction. Its feasibility was tested by performing an fMRI stimulation experiment on a single subject experiencing dentine cold sensitivity. The novel device delivered repetitive, stable air stimuli ranging from room temperature (24.5 °C ± 2 °C) to -35° C, at flow rates between 5 and 17 liters per minute (l/min). These cold air puffs evoked perceptions similar to natural stimuli. Single-subject fMRI-analysis yielded brain activations typically associated with acute pain processing including thalamus, insular and cingulate cortices, somatosensory, cerebellar and frontal brain regions. Thus, the novel CASA allowed for controlled, repetitive quantitative sensory testing by using air stimuli at graded temperatures (room temperature down to –35 °C) while simultaneously recording brain responses. No MR-compatible stimulation device currently exists that is capable of providing non-contact natural-like stimuli at a wide temperature range to tissues in spatially restricted areas such as the mouth. The physical characteristics of this novel device thus holds promise for advancing the field of trigeminal and spinal somatosensory research, namely with respect to comparing therapeutic interventions for dentine hypersensitivity.},

abstract={Background We performed a pilot study using a single virtual-simulation suturing module as an objective measurement to determine functional use of the robotic system. This study will assist in designing a study for an objective, adjunctive test for use by a surgical proctor. Methods After IRB approval, subjects were recruited at a robotic renal surgery course to perform two attempts of the "Tubes" module without warm-up using the Da Vinci® Surgical Skills Simulator(TM). The overall MScore (%) from the simulator was compared among various skill levels to provide construct validity. Correlation with MScore and number of robotic cases was performed and pre-determined skill groups were tested. Nine metrics that make up the overall score were also tested via paired t test and subsequent logistic regression to determine which skills differed among experienced and novice robotic surgeons. Results We enrolled 38 subjects with experience ranging from 0- < 200 robotic cases. Median time to complete both tasks was less than 10 min. The MScore on the first attempt was correlated to the number of previous robotic cases (R2 = 0.465; p = 0.003). MScore was different between novice and more experienced robotic surgeons on the first (44.7 vs. 63.9; p = 0.005) and second attempt (56.0 vs. 69.9; p = 0.037). Conclusion A single virtual simulator exercise can provide objective information in determining proficient use of the robotic surgical system.},

abstract={Introduction: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of executive functions and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of executive functions are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups. Materials and methods: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC); 15 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the executive functions, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of executive functions. Results: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients versus the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of executive functions (neuropsychological battery). Conclusion: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of executive functions is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.},

abstract={Doc number: 153 Abstract Background: In many telemedicine applications, the correct use of medical device at the point of need is essential to provide an appropriate service. Some applications may require untrained people to interact with medical devices and patients: care delivery in transportation, military actions, home care and telemedicine training. Appropriate operation of medical device and correct connection with patient's body are crucial. In these scenarios, tailored applications of Augmented Reality can offer a valid support by guiding untrained people at the point of need. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using Augmented Reality in telemedicine applications, by facilitating an acceptable use of biomedical equipment by any unskilled person. In particular, a prototype system was built in order to estimate how untrained users, with limited or no knowledge, can effectively interact with an ECG device and properly placing ECG electrodes on patient's chest. Methods: An Augmented Reality application was built to support untrained users in performing an ECG test. Simple markers attached to the ECG device and onto patient's thorax allow camera calibration. Once objects and their pose in the space are recognized, the video of the current scene is enriched, in real-time, with additional pointers, text boxes and audio that help the untrained operator to perform the appropriate sequence of operations. All the buttons, switches, ports of the ECG device together with the location of precordial leads were coded and indicated. Some user's voice commands were also included to improve usability. Results: Ten untrained volunteers, supported by the augmented reality, were able to carry out a complete ECG test first on a mannequin and then on a real patient in a reasonable time (about 8 minutes on average). Average positioning errors of precordial electrodes resulted less than 3 mm for the mannequin and less than 7 mm for the real patient. These preliminary findings suggest the effectiveness of the developed application and the validity of clinical ECG recordings. Conclusion: This application can be adapted to support the use of other medical equipment as well as other telemedicine tasks and it could be performed with a Tablet or a Smartphone.},

abstract={Automated perimetry is used for the assessment of visual function in a variety of ophthalmic and neurologic diseases. We report development and clinical testing of a compact, head-mounted, and eye-tracking perimeter (VirtualEye) that provides a more comfortable test environment than the standard instrumentation. VirtualEye performs the equivalent of a full threshold 24-2 visual field in two modes: (1) manual, with patient response registered with a mouse click, and (2) visual grasp, where the eye tracker senses change in gaze direction as evidence of target acquisition. 59 patients successfully completed the test in manual mode and 40 in visual grasp mode, with 59 undergoing the standard Humphrey field analyzer (HFA) testing. Large visual field defects were reliably detected by VirtualEye. Point-by-point comparison between the results obtained with the different modalities indicates: (1) minimal systematic differences between measurements taken in visual grasp and manual modes, (2) the average standard deviation of the difference distributions of about 5 dB, and (3) a systematic shift (of 4-6 dB) to lower sensitivities for VirtualEye device, observed mostly in high dB range. The usability survey suggested patients' acceptance of the head-mounted device. The study appears to validate the concepts of a head-mounted perimeter and the visual grasp mode.},

In this paper, the use of virtual inspection probes to validate playground equipment design is studied, pointing out limits and defining the optimal test strategies. Through the use of Robust Design techniques the authors show that the combined use of real time shadows and positional sound feedback allows to reduce the percentage of wrong inspections in the validation phase of playground equipment design. The authors develop an inspection probe simulation tool in virtual immersive environment. In particular, this tool ensures the collision detection through visual and sound feedback and increases the realism of the immersive environment. Finally, an experimental session, using a physical prototype of playground equipment, is carried out in order to compare these results with the ones coming out from the VR experiments. For a standard entrapment test, the authors assess the dependences of false and missed alarm by the diameter of the openings to evaluate and establish an acceptability threshold for the usability of the virtual probes.},

abstract={System evaluation and testing of unmanned underwater vehicles in their destined environment can be tedious, error prone, time consuming, and consequently expensive. However, pre-real-world testing facilities, such as hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, are not always available. This is due to the time and expense required to create a specific test environment for the vehicle. Thus the system is not as fault tolerant as it could be since problems can remain undetected until the real-world testing phase. Debugging and fixing errors in the real-world testing phase are much more time consuming and expensive owing to the nature of the harsh underwater environment. This paper introduces a novel framework, the augmented-reality framework (ARF), for the rapid construction of virtual-environment testing scenarios for testing remote platforms with embedded systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles. The ARF provides testing facilities across all stages of the reality continuum, providing capabilities for pure simulation, HIL, hybrid simulation, and real-world testing. The framework architecture is both very generic and flexible and allows mixing of real and simulated components. The ARF is supported by a distributed communications protocol which provides location transparency of systems since this is key to providing mixed-reality testing facilities. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Abstract Background: Several neurorehabilitation strategies have been introduced over the last decade based on the so-called simulation hypothesis. This hypothesis states that a neural network located in primary and secondary motor areas is activated not only during overt motor execution, but also during observation or imagery of the same motor action. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the combination of a virtual reality (VR) based neurorehabilitation system together with a wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrument. This combination is particularly appealing from a rehabilitation perspective as it may allow minimally constrained monitoring during neurorehabilitative training. Methods: fNIRS was applied over F3 of healthy subjects during task performance in a virtual reality (VR) environment: 1) 'unilateral' group (N = 15), contralateral recording during observation , motor imagery , observation & motor imagery , and imitation of a grasping task performed by a virtual limb (first-person perspective view) using the right hand; 2) 'bilateral' group (N = 8), bilateral recording during observation and imitation of the same task using the right and left hand alternately. Results: In the unilateral group, significant within-condition oxy-hemoglobin concentration ΔO2 Hb] changes (mean ± SD μmol/l) were found for motor imagery (0.0868 ± 0.5201 μmol/l) and imitation (0.1715 ± 0.4567 μmol/l). In addition, the bilateral group showed a significant within-condition ΔO2 Hb] change for observation (0.0924 ± 0.3369 μmol/l) as well as between-conditions with lower ΔO2 Hb] amplitudes during observation compared to imitation , especially in the ipsilateral hemisphere (p < 0.001). Further, in the bilateral group, imitation using the non-dominant (left) hand resulted in larger ΔO2 Hb] changes in both the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres as compared to using the dominant (right) hand. Conclusions: This study shows that our combined VR-fNIRS based neurorehabilitation system can activate the action-observation system as described by the simulation hypothesis during performance of observation, motor imagery and imitation of hand actions elicited by a VR environment. Further, in accordance with previous studies, the findings of this study revealed that both inter-subject variability and handedness need to be taken into account when recording in untrained subjects. These findings are of relevance for demonstrating the potential of the VR-fNIRS instrument in neurofeedback applications.},

abstract={This study proposes magnetic resonance (MR)-measurement-integrated (MR-MI) simulation, in which the difference between the computed velocity field and the phase-contrast MRI measurement data is fed back to the numerical simulation. The computational accuracy and the fundamental characteristics, such as steady characteristics and transient characteristics, of the MR-MI simulation were investigated by a numerical experiment. We dealt with reproduction of three-dimensional steady and unsteady blood flow fields in a realistic cerebral aneurysm developed at a bifurcation. The MR-MI simulation reduced the error derived from the incorrect boundary conditions in the blood flow in the cerebral aneurysm. For the reproduction of steady and unsteady standard solutions, the error of velocity decreased to 13% and to 22% in one cardiac cycle, respectively, compared with the ordinary simulation without feedback. Moreover, the application of feedback shortened the computational convergence, and thus the convergent solution and periodic solution were obtained within less computational time in the MR-MI simulation than that in the ordinary simulation. The dividing flow ratio toward the two outlets after bifurcation was well estimated owing to the improvement of computational accuracy. Furthermore, the MR-MI simulation yielded wall shear stress distribution on the cerebral aneurysm of the standard solution accurately and in detail.},

abstract={The progression of neurodegenerative diseases as well as healthy aging is accompanied by structural changes of the brain. These changes are often only subtle when considered over time intervals of several months. Therefore morphometrical techniques for their detection in longitudinally acquired MR images must be highly sensitive, and they require a careful validation. In the present study, a novel processing chain for a longitudinal analysis based on deformation field morphometry is described. Procedures for its quantitative validation are also reported: Deformation fields were computed for the simulation of non-linear, local structural changes of human brains. Applying these deformation fields to "original" MR images yielded deformed MR images. The volume changes defined by the deformation fields represented the standard, against which the results of the longitudinal analysis of each pair of original and deformed MR image were compared. The proposed processing chain enabled to localize and to quantify simulated local atrophies near the cortex as well as in deep brain structures. An exemplary analysis of serial MR images of a patient suffering from an atypical Parkinson syndrome (cortico-basal degeneration, CBD) and healthy control subjects is presented, showing a characteristic pattern of volume changes in the brain of the patient which is strikingly different from the controls' patterns of changes.},

abstract={Objective To develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in individual subjects using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification of structural MR (sMR) images. Background Libraries of sMR scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects. Methods One hundred ninety patients with probable AD were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from sMR scans to give STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score; and Models II and III use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-score. Data from 140 AD and 140 CN were used for training. The SVM parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation (CV). The remaining independent sample of 50 AD and 50 CN was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm. Results The CV accuracy of Model II and Model III aSTAND-scores was 88.5% and 89.3%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary AD pathology. Conclusions This paper presents preliminary evidence that application of SVM-based classification of an individual sMR scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of AD. Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract={Background Virtual reality (VR) training has been shown previously to improve intraoperative performance during part of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proficiency-based VR training on the outcome of the first 10 entire cholecystectomies performed by novices. Methods Thirteen laparoscopically inexperienced residents were randomized to either (1) VR training until a predefined expert level of performance was reached, or (2) the control group. Videotapes of each resident's first 10 procedures were reviewed independently in a blinded fashion and scored for predefined errors. Results The VR-trained group consistently made significantly fewer errors (P= .0037). On the other hand, residents in the control group made, on average, 3 times as many errors and used 58% longer surgical time. Conclusions The results of this study show that training on the VR simulator to a level of proficiency significantly improves intraoperative performance during a resident's first 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies.},

abstract={Integration of 3-D electroanatomic mapping with Computed Tomographic (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is gaining acceptance to facilitate catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. This is critically dependent on accurate integration of electroanatomic maps with CT or MR images. We sought to examine the effect of patient- and technique-related factors on integration accuracy of electroanatomic mapping with CT and MR imaging of the left atrium. Sixty-one patients undergoing catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures were included. All patients underwent cardiac CT (n = 11) or MR (n = 50) imaging, and image integration with real-time electroanatomic mapping of the aorta and left atrium (LA). CARTO-Merge software (Biosense-Webster) was used to calculate the overall average accuracy of integration of electroanatomic points with the CT and MR-derived reconstructions of the LA and aorta. There was a significant correlation between LA size assessed by electroanatomic mapping (112 +/- 31 ml) and average integration error (1.9 +/- 0.6 mm) (r = 0.46, p = 0.0003). There was also greater integration error for patients with LA volume >/= 110 ml (n = 31) versus < 110 ml (n = 30) (p = 0.004). In contrast, there was no significant association between average integration error and paroxysmal versus persistent AF, left ventricular ejection fraction, days from imaging to electroanatomic mapping, or images derived from CT versus MR. Patients with larger LA volume may be prone to greater error during integration of electroanatomic mapping with CT and MR imaging. Strategies to reduce integration error may therefore be especially useful in patients with large LA volume.},

abstract={Image registration integrates information from different imaging modalities and has the potential to improve determination of target volume in radiotherapy planning. This paper describes the implementation and validation of a 3D fully automated registration procedure in the process of radiotherapy treatment planning of brain tumors. Fifteen patients with various brain tumors received computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) brain imaging before the start of radiotherapy. First, the normalized mutual information (NMI) method was used for image registration. Registration accuracy was estimated by performing statistical analysis of coordinate differences between CT and MR anatomical landmarks along the x‐, y‐ and z‐axes. Second, a visual validation protocol was developed to validate the quality of individual registration solutions, and this protocol was tested in a series of 36 CT‐MR registration procedures with intentionally applied registration errors. The mean coordinate differences between CT and MR landmarks along the x‐ and y‐axes were in general within 0.5 mm. The mean coordinate differences along the z‐axis were within 1.0 mm, which is of the same magnitude as the applied slice thickness in scanning. In addition, the detection of intentionally applied registration errors by employment of a standardized visual validation protocol resulted in low false‐negative and low false‐positive rates. Application of the NMI method for the brain results in excellent automatic registration accuracy, and the method has been incorporated into the daily routine at our institution. A standardized validation protocol ensures the quality of individual registrations by detecting registration errors with high sensitivity and specificity. This protocol is proposed for the validation of other linear registration methods.PACS numbers: 87.53.Xd, 87.57.Gg},
