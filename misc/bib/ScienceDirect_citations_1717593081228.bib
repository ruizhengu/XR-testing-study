abstract = {Intensity inhomogeneity (bias field) is a common artefact in magnetic resonance (MR) images, which hinders successful automatic segmentation. In this work, a novel algorithm for simultaneous segmentation and bias field correction is presented. The proposed energy functional allows for explicit regularization of the bias field term, making the model more flexible, which is crucial in presence of strong inhomogeneities. An efficient minimization procedure, attempting to find the global minimum, is applied to the energy functional. The algorithm is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using a synthetic example and real MR images of different organs. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique. Desirable results are obtained even for images with strong and complicated inhomogeneity fields and sparse tissue structures.}

Both estimators can adapt to new kinds of MR images simply by training them with those images, which make the algorithm adaptive and extendable. The RBF based estimator performs very well for images that are similar to those in the training data set. The bi-modal linear estimator provides reasonable estimations for a wide range of images that may not be included in the training data set. The data fusion step makes the final estimation of the display parameters accurate for trained images and robust for the unknown images. The algorithm has been tested on a wide range of MR images and has shown satisfactory results.}

abstract = {The traditional Otsu technique for thresholding based on 2D histogram does not give accurate results. A bi-level thresholding case partitions the 2D histogram into four quadrants. This converts the global probability distribution to a probability distribution of two regions only resulting in partial loss of information. The brain regions (white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) have closely defined gray values, which require the intensity difference information for thresholding. So we propose a novel automated absolute intensity difference based (AIDB) technique for optimal MR brain image thresholding using adaptive coral reef optimization (ACRO). The basic idea is to extract the intensity difference information of the brain image from the 2D histogram matrix. A first-hand objective function, depending on the classical between class variance concepts, is investigated, which is maximized by ACRO. The key achievements of our technique are (i) improved thresholding results, (ii) obtaining more homogenous regions of the image and (iii) obtaining more precise shape of the edges. The proposed technique is tested with one hundred slices of the axial T2 – weighted MR brain images of Harvard medical dataset. The Otsu method for multilevel thresholding using the 2D histogram is considered for a comparison. Several performance measures are considered for the evaluation. It is observed that our technique outperforms the other standard methods.}

Objective:
Adaptive and automatic adjustment of the display window parameters for magnetic resonance images under different viewing conditions is a challenging problem in medical image perception. An adaptive hierarchical neural network-based system with online adaptation capabilities is presented to achieve this goal in this paper.
Methodology:
The online adaptation capabilities are primarily attributed to the use of the hierarchical neural networks and the development of a new width/center mapping algorithm. The large training image set is hierarchically organized for efficient user interaction and effective re-mapping of the width/center settings. The width/center mapping functions are estimated from the new user-adjusted width/center values of some representative images by using a global spline function for the entire training images as well as a first-order polynomial function for each selected image sequence. The hierarchical neural networks are then re-trained for the new training data set after this mapping process.
Results:
The proposed automatic display window parameter adjustment system is implemented as a program on a personal computer for testing its adaptation performance. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully adapt its parameter adjustment on a variety of MR images after user re-adjustment and re-training of neural networks.
Conclusion:
This demonstrates the effective adaptation capabilities of the proposed system based on the framework of training data mapping and neural network re-training.}

To capture information about the dynamic nature of the joint, MRI pulse sequences are used to rapidly acquire single-slice kinematic images, which are then used to track the motion of the bone or other tissues. This approach cannot capture true 3D motion information. On the other hand, full 3D acquisitions are time consuming. A more time-efficient alternative to this method that may give accurate 3D motion information may be to use select MRI slices, instead of full resolution 3D models, that may be just enough to capture the vital information needed to track motion. This was tested by removing slices from already acquired full kinematic MRI datasets and progressively removing slices to determine up to what level data can be eliminated and still achieve accurate motion tracking. We evaluated the ability of the reduced data set in tracking motion in terms of both volume overlap and actual motion estimated, and compared these with the results from the full resolution data. We based our analysis of accuracy on the ability to transform the reduced images from one position of the foot to another. In tracking the motion of the bones of the tarsal joints, we were able to reduce the number of slices to about 25% of the full data set while maintaining an accurate representation of motion within about 0.5mm of translation and 0.5 degrees of rotation of the motion estimated from full data.}

abstract = {Automatic segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MR (CMR) images is difficult due to the intensity heterogeneity arising from accumulation of contrast agent in infarcted myocardium. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for automatic 3D segmentation of the LV in LGE CMR images. Given myocardial contours in cine images as a priori knowledge, the framework initially propagates the a priori segmentation from cine to LGE images via 2D translational registration. Two meshes representing respectively endocardial and epicardial surfaces are then constructed with the propagated contours. After construction, the two meshes are deformed towards the myocardial edge points detected in both short-axis and long-axis LGE images in a unified 3D coordinate system. Taking into account the intensity characteristics of the LV in LGE images, we propose a novel parametric model of the LV for consistent myocardial edge points detection regardless of pathological status of the myocardium (infarcted or healthy) and of the type of the LGE images (short-axis or long-axis). We have evaluated the proposed framework with 21 sets of real patient and four sets of simulated phantom data. Both distance- and region-based performance metrics confirm the observation that the framework can generate accurate and reliable results for myocardial segmentation of LGE images. We have also tested the robustness of the framework with respect to varied a priori segmentation in both practical and simulated settings. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can greatly compensate variations in the given a priori knowledge and consistently produce accurate segmentations.}

In this paper, we propose a concatenated set of spatially-localized random forests for multi-atlas-based hippocampus labeling of adult/infant brain MR images. The contribution in our work is two-fold. First, each forest classifier is trained to label just a specific sub-region of the hippocampus, thus enhancing the labeling accuracy. Second, a novel forest selection strategy is proposed, such that each voxel in the test image can automatically select a set of optimal forests, and then dynamically fuses their respective outputs for determining the final label. Furthermore, we enhance the spatially-localized random forests with the aid of the auto-context strategy. In this way, our proposed learning framework can gradually refine the tentative labeling result for better performance. Experiments show that, regarding the large datasets of both adult and infant brain MR images, our method owns satisfactory scalability by segmenting the hippocampus accurately and efficiently.}

abstract = {Background and Objective
Interactive systems for rehabilitation have been widely investigated for motivational purposes. However, more attention should be given to the manner in which user movements are recognized and categorized. This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy of using a clinically-related gesture recognition tool, based on the international biomechanical standards (ISB) for the reporting of human joint motion, for the development of an interactive augmented reality (AR) rehabilitation system —mirrARbilitation.
Methods
This work presents an AR rehabilitation system based on ISB standards, which enables the system to interact and to be configured according to therapeutic needs. The KinectTM skeleton tracking technology was exploited and a new movement recognition method was developed to recognize and classify biomechanical movements. Further, our mirrARbilitation system provides exercise instructions while simultaneously motivating the patient. The system was evaluated on a cohort of 33 patients, physiotherapists, and software developers when performing shoulder abduction therapy exercises. Tests were performed in three moments: (i) users performed the exercise until they feel tired without the help of the system, (ii) the same however using the mirrARbilitation for motivation and guidance, and (iii) users performed the exercise again without the system. Users performing the movement without the help of the system worked as baseline reference.
Results
We demonstrated that the percentage of correct exercises, measured by the movement analysis method we developed, improved from 69.02% to 93.73% when users interacted with the mirrARbilitation. The number of exercise repetitions also improved from 34.06 to 66.09 signifying that our system increased motivation of the users. The system also prevented the users from performing the exercises in a completely wrong manner. Finally, with the help of our system the users' worst result was performing 73.68% of the rehabilitation movements correctly. Besides the engagement, these results suggest that the use of biomechanical standards to recognize movements is valuable in guiding users during rehabilitation exercises.
Conclusion
The proposed system proved to be efficient by improving the user engagement and exercise performance outcomes. The results also suggest that the use of biomechanical standards to recognize movements is valuable in guiding users during rehabilitation exercises.}

In the current paper, we propose a fast and accurate automatic method for lung segmentation and volumetry. Our approach follows a “coarse-to-fine” segmentation strategy. First, we extract the lungs and trachea excluding the main pulmonary vessels. This step is executed very fast and allows for measuring the volume of both structures. Thereafter, we start a refinement procedure that consists of three main stages: trachea extraction, lung separation, and filling the cavities on the final lung masks. After the trachea extraction step the volumes of both lungs without the main vessels can be measured. The final segmentation step results in the volumes of the left and right lungs including the vessels. The method has been tested by processing MR datasets from ten healthy participants. We compare our results with manually produced masks and obtain high agreement between the expert reading and our method: the True Positive Volume Fraction is more than 95%. The proposed automatic approach is fast and accurate enough to be applied in clinical routine for processing of thousands of participants.}

abstract = {Purpose
Dynamic or 4D imaging of the thorax has many applications. Both prospective and retrospective respiratory gating and tracking techniques have been developed for 4D imaging via CT and MRI. For pediatric imaging, due to radiation concerns, MRI becomes the de facto modality of choice. In thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS), patients often suffer from extreme malformations of the chest wall, diaphragm, and/or spine with inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth (Campbell et al., 2003, Campbell and Smith, 2007), as such patient cooperation needed by some of the gating and tracking techniques are difficult to realize without causing patient discomfort and interference with the breathing mechanism itself. Therefore (ventilator-supported) free-breathing MRI acquisition is currently the best choice for imaging these patients. This, however, raises a question of how to create a consistent 4D image from such acquisitions. This paper presents a novel graph-based technique for compiling the best 4D image volume representing the thorax over one respiratory cycle from slice images acquired during unencumbered natural tidal-breathing of pediatric TIS patients.
Methods
In our approach, for each coronal (or sagittal) slice position, images are acquired at a rate of about 200–300ms/slice over several natural breathing cycles which yields over 2000 slices. A weighted graph is formed where each acquired slice constitutes a node and the weight of the arc between two nodes defines the degree of contiguity in space and time of the two slices. For each respiratory phase, an optimal 3D spatial image is constructed by finding the best path in the graph in the spatial direction. The set of all such 3D images for a given respiratory cycle constitutes a 4D image. Subsequently, the best 4D image among all such constructed images is found over all imaged respiratory cycles. Two types of evaluation studies are carried out to understand the behavior of this algorithm and in comparison to a method called Random Stacking – a 4D phantom study and 10 4D MRI acquisitions from TIS patients and normal subjects. The 4D phantom was constructed by 3D printing the pleural spaces of an adult thorax, which were segmented in a breath-held MRI acquisition.
Results
Qualitative visual inspection via cine display of the slices in space and time and in 3D rendered form showed smooth variation for all data sets constructed by the proposed method. Quantitative evaluation was carried out to measure spatial and temporal contiguity of the slices via segmented pleural spaces. The optimal method showed smooth variation of the pleural space as compared to Random Stacking whose behavior was erratic. The volumes of the pleural spaces at the respiratory phase corresponding to end inspiration and end expiration were compared to volumes obtained from breath-hold acquisitions at roughly the same phase. The mean difference was found to be roughly 3%.
Conclusions
The proposed method is purely image-based and post-hoc and does not need breath holding or external surrogates or instruments to record respiratory motion or tidal volume. This is important and practically warranted for pediatric patients. The constructed 4D images portray spatial and temporal smoothness that should be expected in a consistent 4D volume. We believe that the method can be routinely used for thoracic 4D imaging.}

We propose a method for detecting the best symmetry plane in 3D MR brain images. We express this problem as a registration problem and compute a degree of similarity between the image and its reflection with respect to a plane. The best plane is then obtained by maximizing the similarity measure. This optimization is performed using the downhill simplex method and is initialized by a plane obtained from principal inertia axes, which proves to be close to the global optimum. This is demonstrated on several MR brain images. The proposed algorithm is then successfully tested on simulated and real 3D MR brain images. We also investigated the influence of the optimization procedure control parameters on the computation speed and result precision. Preliminary results obtained on CT and SPECT images suggest that the method can be extended to other modalities.}

We use multiple MRI protocols including FLAIR, T1, and T1 with Gd enhancement to gather information about different aspects of the tumor and its vicinity. These include enhancing tissue, nonenhancing tumor, edema, and combinations of edema and tumor. We have adapted the fuzzy connectedness framework for tumor segmentation in this work and the method requires only limited user interaction in routine clinical use. The system has been tested for its precision, accuracy, and efficiency, utilizing 10 patient studies. The percent coefficient of variation (% CV) in volume due to operator subjectivity in specifying seeds for fuzzy connectedness segmentation is less than 1%. The mean operator and computer time required per study for estimating the volumes of both edema and enhancing tumor is about 16min. The software package is designed to run under operator supervision. Delineation has been found to agree with the operators' visual inspection most of the time except in some cases when the tumor is close to the boundary of the brain. In the latter case, the scalp, surgical scar, or orbital contents are included in the delineation, and an operator has to exclude this manually. The methodology is rapid, robust, consistent, yielding highly reproducible measurements, and is likely to become part of the routine evaluation of brain tumor patients in our health system.}

Rather than relying on speed information alone, as done by others and in our own work, we demonstrate that including phase information as a priori knowledge in a Markov random field (MRF) model can improve the quality of segmentation. This is particularly true in the region within an aneurysm where there is a heterogeneous intensity pattern and significant vascular signal loss. We propose to use a Maxwell–Gaussian mixture density to model the background signal distribution and combine this with a uniform distribution for modelling vascular signal to give a Maxwell–Gaussian-uniform (MGU) mixture model of image intensity. The MGU model parameters are estimated by the modified expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. In addition, it is shown that the Maxwell–Gaussian mixture distribution (a) models the background signal more accurately than a Maxwell distribution, (b) exhibits a better fit to clinical data and (c) gives fewer false positive voxels (misclassified vessel voxels) in segmentation. The new segmentation algorithm is tested on an aneurysm phantom data set and two clinical data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide a better quality of segmentation when both speed and phase information are utilised.}

abstract = {We propose a framework for the extraction of biomarkers from low-dimensional manifolds representing inter-subject brain variation. Manifold coordinates of each image capture information about structural shape and appearance and, when a phenotype exists, about the subject’s clinical state. Our framework incorporates subject meta-information into the manifold learning step. Apart from gender and age, information such as genotype or a derived biomarker is often available in clinical studies and can inform the classification of a query subject. Such information, whether discrete or continuous, is used as an additional input to manifold learning, extending the Laplacian Eigenmap objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from pairwise image similarities. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven in contrast to a priori defined biomarkers derived from, e.g., manual or automated segmentations. They form a unified representation of both the imaging and non-imaging measurements, providing a natural use for data analysis and visualization. We test the method to classify subjects with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls enrolled in the ADNI study. Non-imaging metadata used are ApoE genotype, a risk factor associated with AD, and the CSF-concentration of Aβ1-42, an established biomarker for AD. In addition, we use hippocampal volume as a derived imaging-biomarker to enrich the learned manifold. Our classification results compare favorably to what has been reported in a recent meta-analysis using established neuroimaging methods on the same database.}

abstract = {Effective abnormality detection and diagnosis in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) requires a robust segmentation strategy. Since manual segmentation is a time-consuming task which engages valuable human resources, automatic MRI segmentations received an enormous amount of attention. For this goal, various techniques have been applied. However, Markov Random Field (MRF) based algorithms have produced reasonable results in noisy images compared to other methods. MRF seeks a label field which minimizes an energy function. The traditional minimization method, simulated annealing (SA), uses Monte Carlo simulation to access the minimum solution with heavy computation burden. For this reason, MRFs are rarely used in real time processing environments. This paper proposed a novel method based on MRF and a hybrid of social algorithms that contain an ant colony optimization (ACO) and a Gossiping algorithm which can be used for segmenting single and multispectral MRIs in real time environments. Combining ACO with the Gossiping algorithm helps find the better path using neighborhood information. Therefore, this interaction causes the algorithm to converge to an optimum solution faster. Several experiments on phantom and real images were performed. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional MRF and hybrid of MRF-ACO in speed and accuracy.}

Manual liver segmentation is extremely time-consuming and often infeasible requiring automatized methods. Automatic liver segmentation is challenging because of the large variability in liver shape and appearance and the low contrast to neighboring organs. We present a fully automatized liver segmentation framework that uses a sequence of modules based on individualized model knowledge on liver appearance and shape. Liver probability maps are computed that incorporate organ-specific features like MR-intensity distributions, inner-organ MR-differences and liver positions. Probability map generation differentiates automatically between fatty and non-fatty livers. Moreover, we improve an existing technique for prior shape level set segmentation to delineate the liver in tissue-specific liver probability maps and to recognize cystic hepatic tissue. Dice coefficients of 0.937 and low volumetric errors on 35 test data sets confirm the robust segmentation quality of the framework.}

The algorithm performs autonomous stochastic segmentation of tumor in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by combining region based level sets globally and three established energies (uniform, separation and histogram) in a local framework. The local region is defined by the segmentation boundary which, in the case of level set method, consists of global statistics and local energies of every individual point and the local region is then updated by minimizing (or maximizing) the energies. For analysis, the algorithm is tested on low grade and high grade MR images dataset. The obtained results show that the proposed methodology provides similarity between segmented and truth image up to 89.5% by dice method, and minimum distance of 0.5(mm) by Hausdorff algorithm. This adaptive stochastic segmentation algorithm can also be used to compute segmentation when binary thresholding level is greater than 0.2.}

Specifically, the framework is able to distinguish muscular tissue and different types of adipose tissues, i.e. subcutaneous adipose tissue(SAT), inter- and intra-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT and IAMAT), efficiently. Deformable models and learning based techniques are integrated in the novel framework to enable robust quantification. Importantly, extensive evaluations are conducted on a large set of 3D MR thigh volumes from longitudinal studies of hundreds of subjects to investigate radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) related changes of muscular and adipose tissue volumes. The analysis is constructed by two subcohorts (G1 and G2). G2 has 61 patients which keep healthy at baseline (BL) and 48 months (M48), while G1's 85 patients are healthy at BL but have knee OA at M48. Paired t-tests are used to investigate the changes of these tissue size over time passing with/without pathological progression. The experimental results show that, in G1, patients' IMAT and IAMAT are statistically significant respectively, yet G2 has no such variation in the same tissue type. Thus we conclude from the statistical analysis that age may not directly affect thigh tissues, but IMAT and IAMAT may have obvious changes in patients with knee OA.}

Sensitivity, specificity, and similarity were used as performance metrics based on manual (‘gold standard’) injury detection to quantify comparisons. When compared to the manual gold standard, automated injury location results from SIRG performed the best in 62% of the data, while 29% for HRS and 9% for MWS. Injury severity detection revealed that SIRG performed the best in 67% cases while 33% for HRS. Prior information is required by HRS and MWS, but not by SIRG. However, SIRG is sensitive to parameter-tuning, while HRS and MWS are not. Among these methods, SIRG performs the best in detecting lesion volumes; HRS is the most robust, while MWS lags behind in both respects.}

Our segmentation method works independently on MRI and CT-scan volumes and has been tested on a 44 patient dataset and 10 synthetic images. Segmentation and maximum diameter estimation were compared to manual tracing from 4 experts. An inter-observer study was performed in order to measure the variability range of a human observer. Based on three metrics (the maximum aortic diameter, the volume overlap and the Hausdorff distance) the variability of the results obtained by our method is shown to be similar to that of a human operator, both for the lumen interface and the aortic wall. As will be shown, the average distance obtained with our method is less than one standard deviation away from each expert, both for healthy subjects and for patients with AAA. Our semi-automatic method provides reliable contours of the abdominal aorta from CT-scan or MRI, allowing rapid and reproducible evaluations of AAA.}

MR–CT registration methods often rely on the statistical intensity relationship between the images. The proposed similarity measure instead depends on the statistical relationship between the complex phase order between the images. By utilizing the complex phase order likelihood (CPOL) as a similarity measure, structural relationships instead of intensity relationships are explicitly used. This approach can be advantageous for MR–CT registration, where the intensities of the CT imagery have highly complex and nonlinear relationships with the intensities of corresponding MR imagery but simpler linear structural relationships. This new similarity measure has been tested on real MR–CT 3D volumes and has been evaluated based on fiducial registration error to determine alignment accuracy. Quantitative results show that CPOL is capable of achieving comparable alignment accuracy when compared to normalized mutual information, while being more robust to imaging artifacts such as noise.}

abstract = {Segmentation of diseased organs is an important topic in computer assisted medical image analysis. In particular, automatic segmentation of necrotic femoral head is of importance for various corresponding clinical tasks including visualization, quantitative assessment, early diagnosis and adequate management of patients suffering from avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH). Early diagnosis and treatment of ANFH is crucial since the disease occurs in relatively young individuals with an average age of 20–50, and since treatment options for more advanced disease are frequently unsuccessful. The present paper describes several new techniques and software for automatic segmentation of necrotic femoral head based on clinically obtained multi-slice T1-weighted MR data. In vivo MR data sets of 50 actual patients are used in the study. An automatic method built up to manage the segmentation task according to image intensity of bone tissues, shape of the femoral head, and other characters. The processing scheme consisted of the following five steps. (1) Rough segmentation of non-necrotic lesions of the femur by applying a 3D gray morphological operation and a 3D region growing technique. (2) Fitting a 3D ellipse to the femoral head by a new approach utilizing the constraint of the shape of the femur, and employing a principle component analysis and a simulated annealing technique. (3) Estimating the femoral neck location, and also femoral head axis by integrating anatomical information of the femur and boundary of estimated 3D ellipse. (4) Removal of non-bony tissues around the femoral neck and femoral head ligament by utilizing the estimated femoral neck axis. (5) Classification of necrotic lesions inside the estimated femoral head by a k-means technique. The above method was implemented in a Microsoft Windows software package. The feasibility of this method was tested on the data sets of 50 clinical cases (3000 MR images).}

Used together with camera and computer, children could view the superimposed virtual alphabet in a fun and interactive manner using the pattern markers as an interaction tool. Generally, teaching young children could be difficult this is due to the focus of young children is different from elderly since they could only focus on something for short period of time. Introducing the fun and interactive learning could grab the attention therefore enhance teaching and learning for young learner. Fun-learning emphasized interactive learning through play, songs; dance, drama and the use of information and communication technology (ICT). Researches showed that fun learning also increase the ability to memorize and understanding of the user. Flashcard is one of the learning approaches to teach children the alphabet. The tangible manner of flashcard introduce the interaction of learning therefore it could create the joyful learning. However, the potential of flash-card could be further enhance through the use of AR technology. Therefore, introducing the use of AR could encompass fun learning since AR offer rich media learning. Besides displaying each alphabet upon presentation of its corresponding pattern marker, children have the options to see 3D models of objects that begin with each alphabet character. Additional book features includes pattern markers for children to view animation of how each letter is drawn and jigsaw puzzle game for each letter to test children understanding. An informal study was conducted among 15 preschool children aged between 5-6 years old to examine user perception of the book. The preliminary results indicate the children reacted positively towards the books; most reported they like and enjoy using the AR book. Observation of the children behaviors during study corroborates this finding. Most students requested to use the AR book repeatedly. These results suggest the potential of AR book as a tool to create fun learning environment especially for preschool children. Furthermore, the brief interview with the teacher of the preschool also suggested that the system seem to grab the attention of the children.}

abstract = {Background and objectives: Nowadays, clinical practice in Gamma Knife treatments is generally based on MRI anatomical information alone. However, the joint use of MRI and PET images can be useful for considering both anatomical and metabolic information about the lesion to be treated. In this paper we present a co-segmentation method to integrate the segmented Biological Target Volume (BTV), using [11C]-Methionine-PET (MET-PET) images, and the segmented Gross Target Volume (GTV), on the respective co-registered MR images. The resulting volume gives enhanced brain tumor information to be used in stereotactic neuro-radiosurgery treatment planning. GTV often does not match entirely with BTV, which provides metabolic information about brain lesions. For this reason, PET imaging is valuable and it could be used to provide complementary information useful for treatment planning. In this way, BTV can be used to modify GTV, enhancing Clinical Target Volume (CTV) delineation. Methods: A novel fully automatic multimodal PET/MRI segmentation method for Leksell Gamma Knife® treatments is proposed. This approach improves and combines two computer-assisted and operator-independent single modality methods, previously developed and validated, to segment BTV and GTV from PET and MR images, respectively. In addition, the GTV is utilized to combine the superior contrast of PET images with the higher spatial resolution of MRI, obtaining a new BTV, called BTVMRI. A total of 19 brain metastatic tumors, undergone stereotactic neuro-radiosurgery, were retrospectively analyzed. A framework for the evaluation of multimodal PET/MRI segmentation is also presented. Overlap-based and spatial distance-based metrics were considered to quantify similarity concerning PET and MRI segmentation approaches. Statistics was also included to measure correlation among the different segmentation processes. Since it is not possible to define a gold-standard CTV according to both MRI and PET images without treatment response assessment, the feasibility and the clinical value of BTV integration in Gamma Knife treatment planning were considered. Therefore, a qualitative evaluation was carried out by three experienced clinicians. Results: The achieved experimental results showed that GTV and BTV segmentations are statistically correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: 0.898) but they have low similarity degree (average Dice Similarity Coefficient: 61.87 ± 14.64). Therefore, volume measurements as well as evaluation metrics values demonstrated that MRI and PET convey different but complementary imaging information. GTV and BTV could be combined to enhance treatment planning. In more than 50% of cases the CTV was strongly or moderately conditioned by metabolic imaging. Especially, BTVMRI enhanced the CTV more accurately than BTV in 25% of cases. Conclusions: The proposed fully automatic multimodal PET/MRI segmentation method is a valid operator-independent methodology helping the clinicians to define a CTV that includes both metabolic and morphologic information. BTVMRI and GTV should be considered for a comprehensive treatment planning.}

The tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor was significantly hyperintense relative to that of cerebral abscess wall on both diffusion-weighted images and regional cerebral blood volume maps. Sixteen patients who had cerebral masses with large cystic or necrotic cavities were imaged to generate diffusion-weighted images and regional cerebral blood volume maps using single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI) pulse sequences. Apart from qualitative analysis, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) as well as regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratios were calculated from the abscess wall and peripheral tumor wall and comparison was made by using Student's t-test. The tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor had significantly lower ADCs relative to those of the abscess wall (P<0.005) and thus appeared relatively hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images. The mean rCBV ratio relative to normal white matter (2.90±0.62) of the peripheral tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor were significantly larger than the mean rCBV ratio (0.45±0.11) of the pyogenic cerebral abscess wall (P<0.001) by Student's t-test. It is concluded that the combined MR diffusion and perfusion imaging might be capable of differentiating an infected brain tumor from a pyogenic cerebral abscess.}

The brain image pixels that have similar intensity are then grouped into objects using a superpixel algorithm. Further, three clustering techniques are utilized to segment each object. For each clustering technique, a neural network (NN) model is fed with features extracted from the image objects and is trained using the labels produced by that clustering technique. In the testing phase, pre-processing step includes scaling and resizing the brain image are applied then the superpixel algorithm partitions the image into multiple objects (similar to the training phase). The three trained neural network models are then used to predict the respective class of each object and the obtained classes are combined using majority voting. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on various MR brain images and compared with the three base clustering techniques.}

abstract = {This work concerns a new method called fuzzy membership C-means (FMCMs) for segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI), and an efficient program implementation of it to the segmentation of MRI. Classical unsupervised clustering methods including the FCM by Bezdek, suffer many problems that can be partially treated with a proper rule to construct the initial membership matrix to clusters. This work develops a specific method to construct the initial membership matrix to clusters in order to improve the strength of the clusters. The new FMCM is tested on a set of benchmarks and then the application to the segmentation of MR images is presented and compared with the results obtained using FCM.}

abstract = {The four chamber plane is currently underutilized in the right ventricular segmentation community. Four chamber information can be useful to determine ventricular short axis stacks and provide a rough estimate of the right ventricle in short axis stacks. In this study, we develop and test a semi-automated technique for segmenting the right ventricle in four chamber cine cardiac magnetic resonance images. The three techniques that use minimum cost path algorithms were used. The algorithms are: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra), an A* algorithm that uses length, curvature and torsion into an active contour model (ALCT), and a variation of polar dynamic programming (PDP). The techniques are evaluated against the expert traces using 175 cardiac images from 7 patients. The evaluation first looks at mutual overlap metrics and then focuses on clinical measures such as fractional area change (FAC). The mean mutual overlap between the physician's traces ranged from 0.85 to 0.88. Using as reference physician 1′s landmarks and traces (i.e., comparing the traces from physician 1 to the semi-automated segmentation using physician 1′s landmarks), the PDP algorithm has a mean mutual overlap of 0.8970 compared to 0.8912 for ALCT and 0.8879 for Dijkstra. The mean mutual overlap between the BP regions generated by physician 1 and physician 2 landmarks are 0.9674, 0.9605 and 0.9531 for PDP, ALCT and Dijkstra, respectively. The FAC correlation coefficient between the physician's traces ranged from 0.73 to 0.93.}

abstract = {In this paper a variational framework for joint segmentation and motion estimation is employed for inspecting heart in Cine MRI sequences. A functional including Mumford–Shah segmentation and optical flow based dense motion estimation is approximated using the phase-field technique. The minimizer of the functional provides an optimum motion field and edge set by considering both spatial and temporal discontinuities. Exploiting calculus of variation principles, multiple partial differential equations associated with the Euler–Lagrange equations of the functional are extracted, first. Next, the finite element method is used to discretize the resulting PDEs for numerical solution. Several simulation runs are used to test the convergence and the parameter sensitivity of the method. It is further applied to a comprehensive set of clinical data in order to compare with conventional cascade methods. Developmental constraints are identified as memory usage and computational complexities, which may be resolved utilizing sparse matrix manipulations and similar techniques. Based on the results of this study, joint segmentation and motion estimation outperforms previously reported cascade approaches especially in segmentation. Experimental results substantiated that the proposed method extracts the motion field and the edge set more precisely in comparison with conventional cascade approaches. This superior result is the consequence of simultaneously considering the discontinuity in both motion field and image space and including consequent frames (usually five) in our joint process functional.}
