abstract={ObjectivesAs the significance of the early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has emerged, it is necessary to develop corresponding screening tools with high ecological validity and feasible biomarkers. Virtual reality (VR)-based cognitive assessment program, which is close to the daily life of the older adults, can be suitable screening tools for MCI with ecological validity and accessibility. Meanwhile, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been observed at a low concentration in the older adults with dementia or cognitive decline, indicating its potential as a biomarker of MCI. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and usability of a VR cognitive assessment program and salivary DHEA for screening MCI.MethodsThe VR cognitive assessment program and the traditional Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test were performed on 12 patients with MCI and 108 healthy older adults. The VR program operates in a situation of caring for a grandchild, and evaluates the memory, attention, visuospatial, and executive functions. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), a partial correlation analysis, and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were conducted for statistical analysis.ResultsAccording to the ANCOVA, no significant difference in MOCA scores was found between the normal and MCI groups (F = 2.36, p = 0.127). However, the VR total score of the MCI group was significantly lower than that of the normal group (F = 8.674, p = 0.004). There was a significant correlation between the MOCA and VR scores in the total and matched subdomain scores. The ROC curve analysis also showed a larger area under the curve (AUC) for the VR test (0.765) than for the MOCA test (0.598), and the sensitivity and specificity of the VR program were 0.833 and 0.722, respectively. Salivary DHEA was correlated with VR total (R 2 = 0.082, p = 0.01) and attention scores (R 2 = 0.086, p = 0.009).ConclusionThe VR cognitive test was as effective as the traditional MOCA test in the MCI classification and safe enough for older adults to perform, indicating its potential as a diagnostic tool. It has also been shown that salivary DHEA can be used as a biomarker for MCI.},

abstract={IntroductionAccurate acetabular cup and femoral stem component orientation are critical for optimising patient outcomes, reducing complications and increasing component longevity following total hip replacement (THR). This study aimed to determine the accuracy of a novel virtual reality (VR) platform in assessing component orientation in a simulated THR model.MethodsThe VR platform (HTC Vive Pro® system hardware) was compared against the validated Vicon® optical motion capture (MoCap) system. An acetabular cup and femoral stem were manually implanted across a range of orientations into pelvic and femur sawbones, respectively. Simultaneous readings of the acetabular cup operative anteversion (OA) and inclination (OI) and femoral stem alignment (FSA) and neck anteversion (FNA) were obtained from the VR and MoCap systems. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) (Pearson's r) and linear regression (R2).ResultsA total of 55 readings were obtained for the acetabular cup and 68 for the femoral stem model. The mean average differences in OA, OI, FSA and FNA between the systems were 3.44°, -0.01°, 0.01° and -0.04°, respectively. Strong positive correlations were demonstrated between both systems in OA, OI, FSA and FNA, with Pearson's r = 0.92, 0.94, 0.99 and 0.99, and adjusted R2 = 0.82, 0.9, 0.98 and 0.98, respectively.ConclusionThe novel VR platform is highly accurate and reliable in determining both acetabular cup and femoral stem component orientations in simulated THR models. This adaptable and cost-effective digital tracking platform may be modified for use in a range of simulated surgical training and educational purposes, particularly in orthopaedic surgery.},

abstract={Falls in the elderly are a major societal issue. Virtual reality appears as a relevant tool to propose gait training programs to prevent the occurrence of falls. The use of a head-mounted display allows overground walking during fully immersive virtual training sessions. Our long-term ambition is to develop gait training programs with a head-mounted display to propose enjoyable and personalized training content for the elderly. Before proposing these programs, several methodological precautions must be taken. The first concerns the supposed similarity of the adaptive behavior produced in the real world and in virtual reality. The second concerns the acceptance of the virtual reality device before and after use. Twenty older adults performed a locomotor pointing task in three conditions including a real-world condition, a virtual-world condition consisting in a replica of the real-world condition, and a virtual condition in which the locomotor pointing task was performed in a different context. From feet positions in relation to the position of a target, gait adaptability behavior was investigated. In line with previous studies, step adjustments (needed and produced) were investigated through a combination of inter-trial and trial-by-trial analyses. The results highlighted that participants adopted the same gait adaptability behavior whatever the type of environment (real vs. virtual). Gait analyses suggested the use of a generic control mechanism based on information-movement coupling. We also demonstrated that older adults accepted the virtual reality device before and after use. With these methodological locks removed, it is now possible to design training programs in virtual reality to prevent falls in the elderly.},

abstract={Cloud computing offers the opportunity to improve productivity and reduce costs. However, this technology faces high latency problems. In this context, a decentralised cloud paradigm has been introduced in order to bring geographically cloud services close to users. Moreover, the growth of personal devices has stimulated cloud services with further requirements such as compliance (conformance) with a standard or high traffic volume. To cope with these problems, we need assessments to test for example how these requirements can affect the performance degradation in such environments and how we can enhance the distributed cloud architecture in order to perform the end-users objectives. The main contribution in this paper is to suggest a distributed testing approach derived from 'fog computing' design and leveraging its advantages especially optimising response time requirement. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey on distributed cloud architectures, and then we formally suggest a new architecture for testing in such environments. Finally, we illustrate our approach through a case study.},

This manuscript details the development of a smartphone application, entitled “Virtual Reality Bell‐Ringer (VRBR),” capable of displaying monoscopic two‐dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic 3D images with the use of an inexpensive cardboard headset for use in spot examinations. Cadaveric image use, creation, and pinning processes are explained, and the source code is provided. To validate this tool, this paper compares traditional laboratory‐based spot examination assessment stations against those administered using the VRBR application to test anatomical knowledge. Participants (undergraduate, n = 38; graduate, n = 13) completed three spot examinations specific to their level of study, one in each of the modalities (2D, 3D, laboratory) as well as a mental rotation test (MRT), Stereo Fly stereotest, and cybersickness survey. Repeated measures ANCOVA suggested participants performed significantly better on laboratory and 3D stations compared to 2D stations. Moderate to severe cybersickness symptoms were reported by 63% of participants in at least one category while using the VRBR application. Highest reported symptoms included: eye strain, general discomfort, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating. Overall, the VRBR application is a promising tool for its portability, affordability, and accessibility. Due to reported cybersickness and other technical limitations, the use of VRBR as an alternative to cadaveric specimens presents several challenges when testing anatomy knowledge that must be addressed before widespread adoption.},

abstract={In the same indoor lighting conditions, we compare the differences in visual fatigue and comfort between VR devices and smartphone or tablets by the changes in visual fatigue, comfort and visual function of several different VR devices and their corresponding phone or pad before and after watching the same content. The test task is watching the same video, and the test task time for each condition is 40 minutes. The main measures indexes include critical fusion frequency, contrast sensitivity, stereoscopic function, diopter, accommodation and visual fatigue perception scale, etc. One group of test users is students aged 21‐35, and the other group is students aged 9‐15. The results show that there are no significant differences in critical fusion frequency, the contrast sensitivity and the stereoscopic visual indicators between the glasses VR device and the corresponding smartphone screen. But there are significant differences in critical fusion frequency before and after the task (ps<0.05), indicating that visual fatigue occurred after the task. Whereas the other smartphone device and pad after watching video have produced a certain degree of eye tightness and headache. However, the differences between two samples in subjective visual fatigue, comfort, refractive degree and accommodation, contrast sensitivity and so on are not significant. In terms of critical fusion frequency, the decrease in critical fusion frequency of smartphone devices is greater than that of Pad, indicating that the use of smartphone devices has a greater impact on users' ability to identify critical fusion frequency than the use of iPad. The results show that there are a lot of developments in the technology of VR‐HMDs, and their effects on users' visual fatigue and comfort are comparable to those of tablet devices, but they are still different from tablet devices in some aspects.},

abstract={This paper investigates the usability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) methods, traditional PPP with a float-ambiguity solution and with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR), in structural health monitoring applications based on experimental tests using a single-axis shake table. To evaluate the performance of the PPP methodologies, harmonic oscillations of the motion table with amplitudes ranging from 5 to 10 mm and frequency between 0.1 and 3 Hz were generated representing a wide range of possible structural motions. In addition, ground motion similar to those experienced during a real earthquake, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and step motions were generated on the shake table. GNSS PPP–derived positioning results at 20 Hz were compared, in both of the frequency and time domains, with reference data comprising LVDT data and relative positioning data. Results show that both PPP methods’ measurements can be used in the computation of harmonic oscillation frequencies compared to the LVDT and relative positioning values. The observed amplitudes of the harmonic oscillations are slightly different from the LVDT values on the order of millimeters. The results of a step motion experiment demonstrated that PPP-AR is better than traditional PPP in exhibiting quasi-static or static displacement. Moreover, the capabilities of traditional PPP and PPP-AR methods are evaluated with respect to the natural frequency of a small-scale structural model excited on the shake table. The frequency spectrum of this small-scale structural model derived from the PPP methods is consistent with finite-element model (FEM)–predicted values and relative positioning. The research presented here demonstrates the potential of the high-rate GNSS PPP and PPP-AR methods to reliably monitor structural and earthquake-induced vibration frequencies and amplitudes for both structural and seismological applications. Specifically, all results reveal that high-rate PPP-AR is more accurate than traditional PPP for both dynamic and static displacement detection.},

abstract={We use ten common macroeconomic variables to test for the predictability of the quarterly growth rate of house price index (HPI) in the United States during 1975:Q1–2018:Q2. We extend the instrumental variable based Wald statistic (IVX-KMS) proposed by Kostakis, Magdalinos, and Stamatogiannis to a new instrumental variable based Wald statistic (IVX-AR) which accounts for serial correlation and heteroscedasticity in the error terms of the linear predictive regression model. Simulation results show that the proposed IVX-AR exhibits excellent size control regardless of the degree of serial correlation in the error terms and the persistency in the predictive variables, while IVX-KMS displays severe size distortions. The empirical results indicate that the percentage of residential fixed investment in GDP is fairly a robust predictor of the growth rate of HPI. However, other macroeconomic variables’ strong predictive ability detected by IVX-KMS is likely to be driven by the highly correlated error terms in the predictive regressions and thus becomes insignificant when the proposed IVX-AR method is implemented. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEEnhancing subjective well-being is an effective way to improve mental health. This study aimed to validate a virtual realitybased interactive feedback program as an intervention tool for promoting subjective well-being.METHODSThirty-six males participated in this program, consisting of three tasks constructed based on the theories of positive psychology: 'Experience-based problem recognition task', 'Future self-based success story expression task', and 'Strength expression task'. Participants rated visual analog scores associated with each of the tasks' contents. The concurrent validity of task scores was evaluated by correlations with the psychological scale scores.RESULTSThe total task score was positively correlated with scores of Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) emotional wellbeing and psychological well-being, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, Dispositional Hope Scale agency dimension and pathways dimension, and Life Orientation Test Revised, but not with MHC-SF social well-being scores. After controlling for the effects of the other task scores, the task scores had linear relationships with certain psychological assessments.CONCLUSIONSince the task scores are closely related to indicators of well-being, self-esteem, hope, and optimism, the program contents are well associated with certain aspects of subjective well-being and thus may be available for training that improves subjective well-being through interactive feedback.},

abstract={The psychological effects of information technology (IT) use have been widely reported and assessed in the literature. However, although concerns are growing regarding the potential physiological impacts of IT use on the health of IT users, assessment of this issue is currently hampered by the lack of an appropriate information-system (IS) physiological scale. Given the limited utility of existing self-report instruments, the main purpose of this study is to develop an instrument to measure perceived physiological vulnerability to IT use (PPVITU). This study introduces and defines a PPVITU construct, validates this construct and its basic dimensions empirically, develops a generic PPVITU instrument with appropriate psychometric properties, and examines the theoretical and practical applications of this instrument. After analyzing data provided by 308 IT-user respondents, this study proposes a 4-factor, 17-item PPVITU instrument. The authors expect that this empirically validated instrument will be useful to researchers working to develop and test theories of educational technology use as well as to educators working to better understand student perceptions of physiological vulnerability to IT and educational-technology use.},

Many scholars have attempted to import technology into the classroom to help students learn in different subjects. However, students often need assistance with unfamiliar learning approaches and learning environments. This study proposed a non-immersive virtual reality (VR) guidance system combined with a two-tier strategy to help students learn geology knowledge. Two groups of students used different learning approaches: the experimental group students were guided by the two-tier test VR guidance system, and the control group students learned with the conventional VR guidance system. According to the experimental result, the two-tier test VR guidance system not only improved the students' learning achievement in natural science, but also enhanced their learning motivation. In addition, according to the sequential results, we found that VR learning materials or environmental resources can help students answer questions and solve problems more effectively.},

abstract={Antiepileptic drugs impair episodic memory in patients with epilepsy, but this effect has so far only been examined with tests that do not provide first-person experience-an aspect that is crucial for episodic memory. Virtual reality techniques facilitate the development of ecologically valid tests. In the present study, we measure the effect of antiepileptic drug changes in a within-subject design using a virtual reality test in order to provide direct evidence for effects of antiepileptic drugs on episodic memory. Among 106 recruited patients, 97 participated in a virtual reality test up to six times during a 4-day hospitalization, and 78 patients underwent changes in drug load during this period. There were six parallel versions of a virtual town test, with immediate recall and delayed recall after about 12 h. The test requires recall of elements, details, sequence of experience, and egocentric and allocentric spatial memory. We determined drug load by defined daily dose, and compared test performance at lowest antiepileptic drug load to highest antiepileptic drug load. Across the six towns, performance was lower in delayed compared to immediate recall. There was an overall effect of medication when comparing patients taking vs. not taking antiepileptic drugs and/or psychoactive drugs (p = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a within-subject effect of antiepileptic drug load (p = 0.01), indicating lower test performance at higher drug load. There was no effect of gender, daytime, circadian type, depression, seizures, lesions, and epilepsy. For patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, there was no effect of lateralization. The present study provides direct evidence for episodic memory impairment due to antiepileptic drugs, suggesting that a small change in drug load can matter. This study can serve as a proof of principle for the methodology, but a larger sample is needed to examine the differential effects of individual antiepileptic drugs.},

abstract={Science and technology are driving people’s life changes, including education and the environment. Many scholars have attempted to import technology into the classroom to help students learn in different subjects. However, students often need assistance with unfamiliar learning approaches and learning environments. This study proposed a non‐immersive virtual reality (VR) guidance system combined with a two‐tier strategy to help students learn geology knowledge. Two groups of students used different learning approaches: the experimental group students were guided by the two‐tier test VR guidance system, and the control group students learned with the conventional VR guidance system. According to the experimental result, the two‐tier test VR guidance system not only improved the students’ learning achievement in natural science, but also enhanced their learning motivation. In addition, according to the sequential results, we found that VR learning materials or environmental resources can help students answer questions and solve problems more effectively.},

abstract={Motivation to learn is an important component of education, particularly in the field of educational technology in which the instructor's physical presence is increasingly absent. The complexity of the many factors that contribute to student motivation renders this domain difficult to measure. The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) instrument was created to measure and identify issues related to student motivation within the use of self-directed learning materials. The IMMS was designed to measure the degree to which the learner becomes engaged in the learning experience through elements of attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS). Since its creation, several academic studies have made use of the IMMS to assess student motivation, however these studies demonstrate a lack of consensus on the validity and reliability of the instrument. This study examined the validity and reliability of the IMMS as measured by baccalaureate nursing students who completed the IMMS survey instrument following a clinical training simulation. Validation of the survey data retained 19 IMMS items distributed across all four ARCS subscales. The findings reported extend previous validation evidence by validating the instrument with mixed reality instructional simulation. These findings demonstrate the agnostic nature of the IMMS instrument with regard to instructional delivery medium.},

abstract={In recent years, adaptations of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) have shown that socially evaluative stress can effectively elicit psychobiological responses in a standardized way in Virtual Reality (VR). While these methods hold many advantages, the underlying mechanisms of stress-induction effects via virtual avatars are still largely unclear. The present study tested whether the similarity of the real and virtual world modulates the stress response during a virtual TSST by intensifying the experience of presence. For this purpose, two groups performed the TSST-VR while their virtual surroundings were either a replication of the real laboratory or a foreign environment. Although a significant stress response with regard to salivary cortisol, salivary alpha amylase, heart rate and subjective feelings of stress was found in both groups, the parallelization of the real and virtual environment did not lead to an increase in physiological or subjective stress. Furthermore, both groups did not differ in self-reported presence. Beyond reproducing previous findings of successful psychobiological stress induction in VR, the results indicate that the paradigm is effective regardless of the context it is employed in and therefore could be a promising tool in multi-center research projects or clinical applications.},

abstract={As many as half of school children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), resulting in marked negative academic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point- and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2-8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013)., and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping.},

abstract={We aimed to evaluate the use of diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) in the assessment of the varicocele effect on testicular parenchyma and spermatogenesis, with estimation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value changes in the testicular parenchyma. We prospectively evaluated 30 consecutive patients (18 patients with bilateral varicocele and 12 patients with unilateral varicocele) and 10 healthy controls. US and DWI were performed to all patients. A total of 80 testes were included, which divided into three groups: group A: testes ipsilateral to the varicocele (n = 48, 60%); group B: testes contralateral to the varicocele (n = 12, 15%); and group C: normal testes of the control (n = 20, 25%). There was a statistically significant difference in mean ADC value between all groups (p‐value < 0.001). In groups A and B, there was a negative correlation between mean ADC values and varicocele grade as well as pampiniformis venous diameter. In group A, there was a significant positive correlation between mean ADC value and sperm count (p‐value = 0.01, r‐value = 0.48) as well as sperm motility (p‐value = 0.04, r‐value = 0.33). DWI sequence can be used to evaluate the sequel of varicocele, with decreased ADC values that are significantly correlated with abnormal semen parameters. Thus, ADC values may be considered as an ancillary indicator of testicular parenchyma changes.},

abstract={The relationship between obesity and hepatic steatosis is well known, and there are many methods to measure obesity and severity of hepatic steatosis. Because of advances in radiologic techniques, the areas of certain body components can be measured on computed tomography (CT) while the severity of hepatic steatosis can be measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with high accuracy. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between degree of fatty infiltration of the liver measured by MRS and body composition measured from CT images.We evaluated 95 potential liver donors who underwent abdomen CT and liver MRI (including MRS) between February 2014 and September 2015 in a tertiary university hospital. Body composition analysis was performed on CT images using commercial software. The areas of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and abdominal circumference were measured automatically and the area of muscle was measured semi-automatically. The degree of hepatic steatosis was measured by MRS.The degree of hepatic steatosis showed a significant correlation with total fat area, visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, muscle area, abdominal circumference, BMI, and ratio of visceral fat to total fat. The strongest correlation was between hepatic steatosis and the area of visceral fat in all subjects (r=0.569). Multivariate regression analysis showed that male gender and visceral fat area were significantly associated with hepatic steatosis (P = 0.031, <0.001, respectively).The area of visceral fat has the most intimate correlation to the severity of hepatic steatosis among all significantly correlated parameters associated with body habitus. Accurate and quantitative body composition measurement and degree of hepatic steatosis can be noninvasively performed using advanced radiological techniques.},

abstract={This work presents experimental assessment of the improvements to the horizontal ride quality of a railway vehicle equipped with a semi-active magneto-rheological (MR) suspension system. The assessment includes the development of a mathematical model and magnetic circuit analysis of the MR damper, the design and manufacture of MR damper, and field test on the railway. After evaluating the field-dependent damping force characteristics, the conventional passive dampers of the operational railway vehicle are replaced with the MR dampers to evaluate horizontal dynamic characteristics that directly indicates the ride quality of the railway vehicle. Various sensors are installed in the vehicle and a skyhook controller with semi-active condition is implemented to produce an appropriate input current for the generation of the desired damping force. Three periods of testing are undertaken on the railway bridge at 120 km/h and the measured data of acceleration level are recoded and presented.

abstract={The characteristics of a dual-pulse shock caused by an UNDEX (underwater explosion) are described through many standards. Shock signals required to evaluate the survivability of equipment by a shock test machine are also described. To generate various types of shock signals described in the standard, Shock test machines (STMs) require adjustment to various levels of shock occurring in surface ships and submarines. Therefore, the characteristics of each component of a STM should be changeable to generate various shock signals. This paper describes the concept of a STM that can generate various types of dual-pulse shocks. Moreover, this paper suggests an analytic method to determine the characteristics of each component of a STM to generate the required shock signal for various specimens. A method for adjusting the shock signals using a magnetorheological damper is specifically suggested. The results of dynamic analysis using the characteristic values of each component determined by this method shows that the required shock signal can be generated by this concept of the shock test machine.},

abstract={Objective: To assess interrater reliability of the Power Mobility Road Test (PMRT) when administered through the Virtual Reality-based SIMulator-version 2 (VRSIM-2). Design: Within-subjects repeated-measures design. Setting Participants interacted with VRSIM-2 through 2 display options (desktop monitor vs immersive virtual reality screens) using 2 control interfaces (roller system vs conventional movement-sensing joystick), providing 4 different driving scenarios (driving conditions 1-4). Participants performed 3 virtual driving sessions for each of the 2 display screens and 1 session through a real-world driving course (driving condition 5). The virtual PMRT was conducted in a simulated indoor office space, and an equivalent course was charted in an open space for the real-world assessment. After every change in driving condition, participants completed a self-reported workload assessment questionnaire, the Task Load Index, developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Participants: A convenience sample of electric-powered wheelchair (EPW) athletes (N=21) recruited at the 31st National Veterans Wheelchair Games. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Total composite PMRT score. Results: The PMRT had high interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ICC]>.75) between the 2 raters in all 5 driving conditions. Post hoc analyses revealed that the reliability analyses had >80% power to detect high ICCs in driving conditions 1 and 4. Conclusions: The PMRT has high interrater reliability in conditions 1 and 4 and could be used to assess EPW driving performance virtually in VRSIM-2. However, further psychometric assessment is necessary to assess the feasibility of administering the PMRT using the different interfaces of VRSIM-2.},

abstract={The use of virtual reality (VR) for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. This reliability study included 46 asymptomatic participants, who were assessed using the neck VR system which displayed an interactive VR scenario via a head-mounted device, controlled by neck movements. The objective of the interactive assessment was to hit 16 targets, randomly appearing in four directions, as fast as possible. Each participant was tested twice by two different testers. Good reliability was found of neck motion kinematic measures in flexion, extension, and rotation (0.64-0.93 inter-class correlation). High reliability was shown for peak velocity globally (0.93), in left rotation (0.9), right rotation and extension (0.88), and flexion (0.86). Mean velocity had a good global reliability (0.84), except for left rotation directed movement with moderate reliability (0.68). Minimal detectable change for peak velocity ranged from 41 to 53 degree /s, while mean velocity ranged from 20 to 25 degree /s. The results suggest high reliability for peak and mean velocity as measured by the interactive Neck VR assessment of neck motion kinematics. VR appears to provide a reliable and more ecologically valid method of cervical motion evaluation than previous conventional methodologies.},

abstract={This study was to determine face and construct validity of a new virtual reality-based shoulder arthroscopy simulator which uses passive haptic feedback. Fifty-one participants including 25 novices (100 shoulder arthroscopies) completed two tests: for assessment of face validity, a questionnaire was filled out concerning quality of simulated reality and training potential using a 7-point Likert scale (range 1-7). Construct validity was tested by comparing simulator metrics (operation time in seconds, camera and grasper pathway in centimetre and grasper openings) between novices and experts test results. Overall simulated reality was rated high with a median value of 5.5 (range 2.8-7) points. Training capacity scored a median value of 5.8 (range 3-7) points. Experts were significantly faster in the diagnostic test with a median of 91 (range 37-208) s than novices with 1177 (range 81-383) s (p < 0.0001) and in the therapeutic test 102 (range 58-283) s versus 229 (range 114-399) s (p < 0.0001). Similar results were seen in the other metric values except in the camera pathway in the therapeutic test. The tested simulator achieved high scores in terms of realism and training capability. It reliably discriminated between novices and experts. Further improvements of the simulator, especially in the field of therapeutic arthroscopy, might improve its value as training and assessment tool for shoulder arthroscopy skills. II.},

Yet, the existing asymptotic analysis of this test statistic is limited to a model in which the errors are assumed to follow a simple AR(1) structure with homogenous autoregressive coefficients. One reason for this is that the model involves an intricate identification issue, as both the serial and cross-section correlation structures of the errors are unobserved. The purpose of the current paper is to tackle this issue and in so doing extend the existing analysis to the case of AR(...) errors with possibly heterogeneous coefficients.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDWe propose a virtual reality (VR) model, reproducing a house environment, where color modification of target places, obtainable by home automation in a real ambient, was tested by means of a P3b paradigm. The target place (bathroom door) was designed to be recognized during a virtual wayfinding in a realistic reproduction of a house environment. Different color and luminous conditions, easily obtained in the real ambient from a remote home automation control, were applied to the target and standard places, all the doors being illuminated in white (W), and only target doors colored with a green (G) or red (R) spotlight. Three different Virtual Environments (VE) were depicted, as the bathroom was designed in the aisle (A), living room (L) and bedroom (B). EEG was recorded from 57 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy subjects in the 60-80 year age range (O-old group) and 12 normal cases in the 20-30 year age range (Y-young group).RESULTSIn Young group, all the target stimuli determined a significant increase in P3b amplitude on the parietal, occipital and central electrodes compared to frequent stimuli condition, whatever was the color of the target door, while in elderly group the P3b obtained by the green and red colors was significantly different from the frequent stimulus, on the parietal, occipital, and central derivations, while the White stimulus did not evoke a significantly larger P3b with respect to frequent stimulus.DISCUSSIONThe modulation of P3b amplitude, obtained by color and luminance change of target place, suggests that cortical resources, able to compensate the age-related progressive loss of cognitive performance, need to be facilitated even in normal elderly. The event-related responses obtained by virtual reality may be a reliable method to test the environmental feasibility to age-related cognitive changes.},

abstract={The binomial AR(1) model describes a nonlinear process with a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) structure and a binomial marginal distribution. To develop goodness-of-fit tests for the binomial AR(1) model, we investigate the observed marginal distribution of the binomial AR(1) process, and we tackle its autocorrelation structure. Motivated by the family of power-divergence statistics for handling discrete multivariate data, we derive the asymptotic distribution of certain categorized power-divergence statistics for the case of a binomial AR(1) process. Then we consider Bartlett's formula, which is widely used in time series analysis to provide estimates of the asymptotic covariance between sample autocorrelations, but which is not applicable when the underlying process is nonlinear. Hence, we derive a novel Bartlett-type formula for the asymptotic distribution of the sample autocorrelations of a binomial AR(1) process, which is then applied to develop tests concerning the autocorrelation structure. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the size and power of the proposed tests under diverse alternative process models. Several real examples are used to illustrate our methods and findings.},

abstract={In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of a simple experiment being developed to validate the existence of a low-energy component to the super(40)Ca(n, alpha ) super(37)Ar reaction cross-section. The super(40)Ca(n, alpha ) super(37)Ar reaction cross-section is of importance here in that it is one of several variables responsible for establishing the amount of super(37)Ar that might be detected during a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) On-Site Inspection (OSI). The proposed experiment involves first irradiating a calcium oxalate (CaC sub(2)O sub(4)) sample with a cold neutron beam supplied by the Texas Cold Neutron Source 1] and then subsequently counting the irradiated calcium oxalate sample using a Si-PIN diode spectrometer prototype developed by XIA LLC 2]. The presence of an super(37)Ar peak in the spectrum acquired by the Si-PIN diode spectrometer would indicate that there is in-fact a low-energy component to the super(40)Ca(n, alpha ) super(37)Ar reaction cross-section.},

title={Development and validation of a novel method to derive central aortic systolic pressure from the MR aortic distension curve: JMRI},

abstract={Purpose Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) is a more accurate measure of load and cardiovascular risk than brachial pressure. Unfortunately, CASP is difficult to measure using current methods. In this study we report three methods of determining CASP by combining MR-derived aortic area curves with different models of the pressure-area relationship. Materials and Methods CASP was derived by calibrating aortic area curves to the brachial mean and diastolic pressure, using: linear, exponential, and arctangent models in 20 volunteers using a high temporal resolution spiral PC-MR flow sequence. The arctangent model also required calibration with pulse wave velocity. Carotid tonometry CASP was used as the reference standard. Results Brachial systolic pressure correlated only moderately with carotid CASP r2=0.46 (P=0.01). However, arctangent, exponential, and linear CASP correlated strongly with carotid CASP, r2=0.90, r2=0.86, r2=0.85, respectively (P<0.0001). There was excellent agreement between carotid CASP and both arctangent (bias 1.5; SD 3.3) and exponential CASP (bias 0.6; SD 3.6). There was a slight underestimation using the linear model (bias -2.3; SD 3.8) and poor agreement and overestimation using brachial systolic pressure (bias 12.9; SD 8.0). Conclusion We have shown that CASP can be derived from MR data: arctangent and exponential methods being superior to the linear method. The superior correlation of MR derived CASP over brachial systolic BP suggests these measures will allow more comprehensive assessment of systemic arterial hypertension.J. Magn. Reson.

abstract={Purpose MRI is used to obtain quantitative oxygenation and blood volume information from the susceptibility-related MR signal dephasing induced by blood vessels. However, analytical models that fit the MR signal are usually not accurate over the range of small blood vessels. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated limitations in the simultaneous assessment of oxygenation and blood volume. In this study, a multiparametric MRI framework that aims to measure vessel radii in addition to magnetic susceptibility and volume fraction was introduced. Methods The protocol consisted of gradient-echo sampling of the spin-echo, diffusion, T2, and B0 acquisitions. After correction steps, the data were postprocessed with a versatile numerical model of the MR signal. An important analytical model was implemented for comparison. The approach was validated in phantoms with coiling strings as proxy for blood vessels. Results The feasibility of the vessel radius measurement is demonstrated. The numerical model shows an improved accuracy compared with the analytical approach. However, both methods overestimate the radius. The simultaneous measurement of the magnetic susceptibility and the volume fraction remains challenging. Conclusion The results suggest that this approach could be interesting in vivo to better characterize the microvasculature without contrast agent.

abstract={To explore the principle and to optimize the nonlinear Eddy Current Testing (ECT) system, a forward numerical analysis code for nonlinear ECT signal simulation is indispensable. In this paper, an edge element numerical code of the transient Ar (reduced A) formulation is developed for this purpose. The nonlinear feature of the permeability in each element is taken into account at every time step during step by step numerical integration procedure. The dependence of the third harmonic component of the response signals on the initial permeability is investigated by using the developed code. The qualitative agreement of the simulation and the experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed simulation method and the corresponding numerical code.},

abstract={The experiment presented provides partial cross-cultural empirical support for Pascal Boyer's theory of the transmission of minimally counterintuitive (MCI) ideas. Boyer hypothesized that concepts with a small number of counterintuitive features are better remembered and more faithfully communicated than extremely counterintuitive concepts or comparable ordinary or even unusual concepts. This transmission advantage may help to explain the cross-cultural ubiquity of religious/supernatural concepts, which often have counterintuitive features. The experiment was conducted in Second Life, an online 3D virtual world. Fifty English-speaking western participants and 51 Chinese-speaking participants from far-eastern nations viewed intuitive and counterintuitive test items and then were asked to free recall the displays immediately and after varying delays. Results show that MCI displays were not better recalled than intuitive displays at initial reporting. For both samples, however, the amount of time elapsed since exposure to the test items correlated significantly with memory degradation for intuitive concepts but not for counterintuitive concepts. These results suggest that although MCI concepts may not be more easily encoded than intuitive concepts, once they are encoded they may be more easily retrieved than intuitive concepts. Results also show that, among the westerners, increased age predicted poorer delayed recall of MCI but not intuitive items, suggesting that the MCI effect may bear most directly on transmitting ideas to adolescents and young adults.

abstract={This paper deals with the problem of adaptive detection for range-spread targets with unknown complex amplitude and known Doppler in the presence of compound-Gaussian clutter modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process with unknown parameters. Since no uniformly most powerful test exists for this problem, we devise and assess the AR-model-based detection strategy based on the Wald test. The unknown parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood criterion only under hypothesis H sub(1) for the use in Wald test. Different to the traditional covariance-matrix-based detectors, we consider no secondary data; the AR-model-based detector adjusts itself to the environment utilizing only the primary data in the cells under test. Moreover, the AR-model-based Wald test ensure the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the clutter power level, and are asymptotically CFAR with respect to the clutter covariance matrix. Finally, the performance assessments, conducted by Monte Carlo simulations, also in comparison to previously proposed detectors, have shown the newly proposed detector possesses better detection performance than its counterpart resorting to the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approach. In addition, the newly proposed AR-model-based Wald test possesses the same asymptotical performance as the two-step GLRT-based detector with perfect knowledge about the clutter covariance matrix.},

The model is a fixed-effect panel version of the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression of order 1. Individual-specific linear trends may also be included. The test statistics are t -type statistics based on least-squares estimates from which the Nickell bias is removed. Their limiting distributions (for an increasing number of independent cross-section units, N , and fixed T ) are standard normal. Our test generalizes the panel unit root test of Harris and Tzavalis, which is based on an unaugmented Dickey-Fuller regression. As an illustration, we examine whether the Law of One Price holds in the European car market since the start of stage three of the EMU in 1999.

abstract={Background: Clematichinenoside AR is a promising lead compound for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A systematic research for the related impurities in AR bulk samples is still lacking. For the safe use of this natural product in future clinical practice, the structure and content of each constituent, including the main ingredient as well as the impurities in AR bulk sample must be characterized in detail. Results: A simple and stability indicating RP-HPLC method was developed and validated for determining the purity of clematichinenoside AR (AR), a natural product from the roots of Clematis manshurica Rupr. (Ranunculaceae) with the potential of treating rheumatoid arthritis. Five impurities were characterized, and impurity 2 (Clematomandshurica saponin F) is a new triterpenoid saponin isolated from this product. Optimum separation for clematichinenoside AR and five related impurities was carried out on an Agilent octadecylsilane bonded silica gel column (TC-C18, 4.6 mm 150 mm, 5 mu]m) using a gradient HPLC method. The validation results showed good sensitivity, specificity, linearity(r super(2)>0.9992) precision(RSD<1.63%), accuracy(recoveries in the range of 95.60%-104.76%) and robustness. Three AR bulk samples containing all the impurities were examined by two methods, and the stability of correction factors for the determination of related impurities was discussed. The proposed stability-indicating method was suitable for the quality control of this natural product. Conclusion: Five related impurities of clematichinenoside AR were characterized, including a new triterpenoid saponins firstly found in clematichinenoside AR bulk samples. In the simple chromatographic method for determining clematichinenoside AR and its related impurities in bulk samples, the correction factor was better for the quality control in the relative stable concentrations.},

abstract={Robotic surgery provides many benefits such as reduced invasiveness and increased dexterity. This comes at the cost of no direct contact between surgeon and patient. This physical separation prevents surgeons from performing direct haptic exploration of tissues and organs, imposing exclusive reliance on visual cues. Current technology is not yet able to both measure and reproduce a realistic and complete sense of touch (interaction force, temperature, roughness, etc.). In this paper we put forward a concept based on multimodal feedback consisting of the integration of different kinds of visual and tactile cues with force feedback that can potentially improve both the surgeon's performance and the patient's safety. We present a cost-effective tactile display simulating a pulsating artery that has been integrated into a haptic workstation to combine both tactile and force-feedback information. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different feedback types, including tactile and/or visual cues, on the performance of subjects carrying out two typical palpation tasks: (1) exploring a tissue to find a hidden artery and (2) identifying the orientation of a hidden artery. The results show that adding tactile feedback significantly reduces task completion time. Moreover, for high difficulty levels, subjects perform better with the feedback condition combining tactile and visual cues. As a matter of fact, the majority of the subjects in the study preferred this combined feedback because redundant feedback reassures subjects in their actions. Based on this work, we can infer that multimodal haptic feedback improves subjects' performance and confidence during exploratory procedures.},

abstract={MR fluid squeeze mode investigations at CVeSS have shown that MR fluids show large force capabilities in squeeze mode. It was found that MR fluids in squeeze mode may be used in a wide range of applications such as engine mounts and impact dampers. In these applications, MR fluid is flowing in a dynamic environment due to the transient nature of inputs and system characteristics. The research presented in this article undertakes the problem of dynamic testing and modeling of MR fluid squeeze mounts. Dynamic tests of an MR mount are studied for different applied currents, initial gaps, frequencies, and excitation amplitudes. An effective mathematical model of the MR squeeze mount for steady-state testing was built which includes the effect of the inertia of the fluid. The results show that the compression force and the area of the hysteresis loop increase with the increase of excitation amplitude or applied current and it will decrease with the increase of frequency or initial gap. Also, the inertia effect becomes more significant for higher displacement frequencies. The mathematical model agrees with the test data very well during the compression process and it can be used for the dynamics analysis and the real-time control.},

abstract={This paper presents a framework and detailed vision for using immersive virtual reality (VR) environments to improve the design, verification, validation, and manufacture of medical devices. Major advances in medical device design and manufacture currently require extensive and expensive product cycles that include animal and clinical trials. The current design process limits opportunities to thoroughly understand and refine current designs and to explore new high-risk, high-payoff designs. For the past 4 years, our interdisciplinary research group has been working toward developing strategies to dramatically increase the role of simulation in medical device engineering, including linking simulations with visualization and interactive design. Although this vision aligns nicely with the stated goals of the FDA and the increasingly important role that simulation plays in engineering, manufacturing, and science today, the interdisciplinary expertise needed to realize a simulation-based visual design environment for real-world medical device design problems makes implementing (and even generating a system-level design for) such a system extremely challenging. In this paper, we present our vision for a new process of simulation-based medical device engineering and the impact it can have within the field. We also present our experiences developing the initial components of a framework to realize this vision and applying them to improve the design of replacement mechanical heart valves. Relative to commercial software packages and other systems used in engineering research, the vision and framework described are unique in the combined emphasis on 3D user interfaces, ensemble visualization, and incorporating state-of-the-art custom computational fluid dynamics codes. We believe that this holistic conception of simulation-based engineering, including abilities to not just simulate with unprecedented accuracy but also to visualize and interact with simulation results, is critical to making simulation-based engineering practical as a tool for major innovation in medical devices. Beyond the medical device arena, the framework and strategies described may well generalize to simulation-based engineering processes in other domains that also involve simulating, visualizing, and interacting with data that describe spatially complex time-varying phenomena.},

The first objective was to use virtual reality to validate groups of individuals with low, moderate, and high levels of unfounded persecutory ideation. The second objective was to investigate, drawing upon a cognitive model of persecutory delusions, whether clinical and nonclinical paranoia are associated with similar causal factors. Three groups (low paranoia, high nonclinical paranoia, persecutory delusions) of 30 participants were recruited. Levels of paranoia were tested using virtual reality. The groups were compared on assessments of anxiety, worry, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anomalous perceptual experiences, reasoning, and history of traumatic events. Virtual reality was found to cause no side effects. Persecutory ideation in virtual reality significantly differed across the groups. For the clear majority of the theoretical factors there were dose-response relationships with levels of paranoia. This is consistent with the idea of a spectrum of paranoia in the general population. Persecutory ideation is clearly present outside of clinical groups and there is consistency across the paranoia spectrum in associations with important theoretical variables. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This paper experimentally investigates the feasibility of an adaptive passive control system, which consists of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper and an electromagnetic induction (EMI) part, for suppressing vibration of building structures subjected to ground accelerations. In the adaptive passive control system, the EMI part composed of a permanent magnet and a coil convert the kinetic energy of the relative motion between a building and a damper into the electric energy, which is used for a change in damping characteristics of the MR fluid damper. Since the EMI part can be used as a controller, which determines the command voltage input according to structural responses as well as a power source, the adaptive passive system can be much more compact, convenient, and economic than a conventional active/semiactive system that needs a power supply, a controller, and sensors. To experimentally verify the feasibility of the adaptive passive control system, a shaking table test of a small-scale building model employing the MR fluid damper with the EMI part is conducted. The performance of the adaptive passive control system is compared with that of passively operated MR fluid damper-based semiactive control systems.},

abstract={The real-time hybrid testing method (RT-HYTEM) is a structural testing technique in which the numerical integration of the equation of motion for a numerical substructure and the physical testing for an experimental substructure are performed simultaneously in real-time. This article presents the quantitative evaluation of the seismic performance of a building structure installed with a magnetorheological (MR) damper using RT-HYTEM. A building model is identified from the force-vibration testing results of a full-scale five-story building and is used as the numerical substructure, and an MR damper corresponding to an experimental substructure is physically tested using a universal testing machine (UTM). First, the force required to drive the displacement of the story, at which the MR damper is located, is measured from the load cell attached to the UTM. The measured force is then returned to a control computer to calculate the response of the numerical substructure. Finally, the experimental substructure is excited by the UTM with the calculated response of the numerical substructure. The RT-HYTEM implemented in this study is validated because the real-time hybrid testing results obtained by application of sinusoidal and earthquake excitations and the corresponding analytical results obtained using the Bouc-Wen model as the control force of the MR damper with respect to input currents are in good agreement. Also, the results from RT-HYTEM for the passive -on and -off control show that the structural responses did not decrease further by the excessive control force, but decreased due to the increase of the current applied to the MR damper. Also, two semi-active control algorithms (modulated homogeneous friction and the clipped-optimal control algorithms) are applied to the MR damper in order to optimally control the structural responses. To compare the RT-HYTEM and numerical results, Bouc-Wen model parameters are identified for each input current. The results of the comparison of experimental and numerical responses show that it is more practical to use RT-HYTEM in semi-active devices such as MR dampers. The test results show that a control algorithm can be experimentally applied to the MR damper using RT-HYTEM. This article provides a discussion on each algorithm with respect to the seismic performances.},

abstract={Health professionals need to be able to communicate information about genomic susceptibility in understandable and usable ways, but substantial challenges are involved. We developed four learning modules that varied along two factors: (1) learning mode (active learning vs. didactic learning) and (2) metaphor (risk elevator vs. bridge) and tested them using a 2 x 2 between-subjects, repeated measures design. The study used an innovative virtual reality technology experimental platform; four virtual worlds were designed to convey the concept that genetic and behavioral factors interact to affect common disease risk. The primary outcome was comprehension (recall, transfer). Study participants were 42 undergraduates aged 19-23. The results indicated that the elevator metaphor better supported learning of the concept than the bridge metaphor. Mean transfer score was significantly higher for the elevator metaphor (p < 0.05). Mean change in recall was significantly higher for didactic learning than active learning (p < 0.05). Mean ratings for variables posited to be associated with better learning (e.g., motivation), however, were generally higher for the active learning worlds. The results suggested that active learning might not always be more effective than didactic learning in increasing comprehension of health information. The findings also indicated that less complex metaphors might convey abstract concepts more effectively.},

abstract={Robotic surgery is an accepted adjunct to minimally invasive surgery, but training is restricted to console time. Virtual-reality (VR) simulation has been shown to be effective for laparoscopic training and so we seek to validate a novel VR robotic simulator. The American Urological Association (AUA) Office of Education approved this study. Subjects enrolled in a robotics training course at the 2007 AUA annual meeting underwent skills training in a da Vinci dry-lab module and a virtual-reality robotics module which included a three-dimensional (3D) VR robotic simulator. Demographic and acceptability data were obtained, and performance metrics from the simulator were compared between experienced and nonexperienced roboticists for a ring transfer task. Fifteen subjects-four with previous robotic surgery experience and 11 without-participated. Nine subjects were still in urology training and nearly half of the group had reported playing video games. Overall performance of the da Vinci system and the simulator were deemed acceptable by a Likert scale (0-6) rating of 5.23 versus 4.69, respectively. Experienced subjects outperformed nonexperienced subjects on the simulator on three metrics: total task time (96 s versus 159 s, P < 0.02), economy of motion (1,301 mm versus 2,095 mm, P < 0.04), and time the telemanipulators spent outside of the center of the platform's workspace (4 s versus 35 s, P < 0.02). This is the first demonstration of face and construct validity of a virtual-reality robotic simulator. Further studies assessing predictive validity are ultimately required to support incorporation of VR robotic simulation into training curricula.},

abstract={We measured the movements of soccer players heading a football in a fully immersive virtual reality environment. In mid-flight the ball's trajectory was altered from its normal quasi-parabolic path to a linear one, producing a jump in the rate of change of the angle of elevation of gaze (alpha) from player to ball. One reaction time later the players adjusted their speed so that the rate of change of alpha increased when it had been reduced and reduced it when it had been increased. Since the result of the player's movement was to regain a value of the rate of change close to that before the disturbance, the data suggest that the players have an expectation of, and memory for, the pattern that the rate of change of alpha will follow during the flight. The results support the general claim that players intercepting balls use servo control strategies and are consistent with the particular claim of Optic Acceleration Cancellation theory that the servo strategy is to allow alpha to increase at a steadily decreasing rate.},

This study investigates a model of the ionisation chambers using a different approach, analysing the collected charge per minute as a response of the detector instead of the dose. The MCNPX Monte Carlo code is used. In this paper, the model is validated using a well-known irradiation field only: a super(60)Co source. The detailed MCNPX models of a Mg(Ar) and TE(TE) ionisation chamber is investigated comparing the measured charge per minute obtained free-in-air and in a water phantom with the simulated results. The difference between the calculations and the measurements for the TE(TE) chamber is within plus or minus 2% whereas for the Mg(Ar) chamber is around +7%. The systematic discrepancy in the case of Mg(Ar) chamber is expected to be caused by an overestimation of the sensitive volume.},

abstract={Rationale and Objectives - Conventional tractography sed on the "streamline" method only partially visualizes the pyramidal tract because of fiber crossing with other white matter tracts. Recently a new tractography method sed on directional diffusion function (DDF) has been proposed. This method was reported to visualize the pyramidal tract to a larger extent than conventional techniques do. To validate the DDF-based tractography method, we studied the somatotopic organization of the pyramidal tract in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC). Materials and Methods - Pyramidal tracts in the intact hemispheres of 14 brain tumor patients were drawn using the directional diffusion function-based tractography method. Each pyramidal tract was divided into four fiber bundles according to the cephalocaudal positions of their termination in the precentral gyrus. The cephalocaudal positions in the precentral gyrus of the four fiber bundles were correlated with their positional relationships in the PLIC along the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes. Results - Fiber bundles terminating more caudally in the precentral gyrus were located significantly more anteriorly in the PLIC (r = 0.59, Spearman's correlation coefficient, P < .0001). On the other hand, no significant correlation was shown between the cephalocaudal positions in the precentral gyrus of the four fiber bundles and their relative positions in the PLIC along the mediolateral axis. Conclusions - Estimated organization of the fiber bundles of the pyramidal tract in the PLIC was consistent with anatomically known somatotopic organization, which supported the validity of the DDF-based tractography method.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDVirtual reality simulators are a component of the armamentarium for training surgical residents. No one knows exactly how to incorporate virtual reality simulators into a curriculum. The purpose of this study was to document and show the learning curve and test-retest reliability of 2 tasks on a virtual reality-training simulator (LapSim; Surgical Science, Göteborg, Sweden) in laparoscopic surgery.METHODSTwenty-nine medical students participated in 8 iterations of 7 virtual reality tasks ("camera navigation" (CN), "instrument navigation," "coordination," "grasping," "lifting and grasping" (LG), "cutting," and "clip applying") Learning curves for each outcome variable of the CN and LG tasks were generated. Using ANOVA, we evaluated the differences between each score from attempt number 7 to attempt number 8 to document test-retest reliability.RESULTSA plateau in the learning curve occurred within 8 sessions for CN misses, CN tissue damage, CN maximum damage, and LG maximum damage. Over the course of 8 sessions, a plateau in the learning curve was nearly reached for CN time, CN drift, CN path, CN angular path, and LG left and right path. The following variables had a downward trend to the mean learning curve over 8 sessions, but they did not reach a plateau: LG time, LG left and right miss, LG left and right angular path, and LG tissue damage.CONCLUSIONUsing the LapSim virtual reality simulator, we documented a learning curve and test-retest reliability for each outcome variable for CN and LG for rank novices. The modeling of the general learning curve is useful in designing training program. These results may be important in developing standards for technical evaluation in a surgical training curriculum.},

abstract={PURPOSEThe need to develop new methods of surgical training combined with advances in computing has led to the development of sophisticated virtual reality surgical simulators. The PERC Mentortrade mark is designed to train the user in percutaneous renal collecting system access puncture. We evaluated and established face, content and construct validation of the simulator in this task.MATERIALS AND METHODSA total of 63 trainees underwent baseline testing on the simulator, consisting of percutaneous renal puncture followed by the introduction of a guidewire into the collecting system. Subjects were then randomized to an intervention arm, in which they underwent 2, 30-minute training sessions on the simulator, and a control arm, in which no further training was given, followed by repeat testing. Performance was assessed using a global rating scale and by virtual reality derived parameters.RESULTSThere were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to baseline measures. Subjects who underwent training with the simulator demonstrated significant improvement in objective and subjective parameters compared to their baseline performance and compared to the untrained control group. Spearman rank correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between multiple parameters of the objective and subjective data.CONCLUSIONSTraining on the simulator improves virtual reality skills. It may allow trainees to develop the basic skills necessary to perform percutaneous renal collecting system access. Face and content validity were demonstrated and construct validity was supported by establishing convergent validity.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: Brain volumetry is widely used for evaluating tissue degeneration; however, the parcellation methods are rarely validated and use arbitrary planes to mark boundaries of brain regions. The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and apply an MR imaging tracing method for the parcellation of 3 major gyri of the frontal lobe, which uses only local landmarks intrinsic to the structures of interest, without the need for global reorientation or the use of dividing planes or lines. METHODS: Studies were performed on 25 subjects-healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease-with significant variation in the underlying gyral anatomy and state of atrophy. The protocol was evaluated by using multiple observers tracing scans of subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease and those aging normally, and the results were compared by spatial overlap agreement. To confirm the results, observers marked the same locations in different brains. We illustrated the variabilities of the key boundaries that pose the greatest challenge to defining consistent parcellations across subjects. RESULTS: The resulting gyral volumes were evaluated, and their consistency across raters was used as an additional assessment of the validity of our marking method. The agreement on a scale of 0-1 was found to be 0.83 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for the same rater and 0.85 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for 2 different raters. The results revealed that the protocol remained consistent across different neurodegenerative conditions. CONCLUSION: Our method provides a simple and reliable way for the volumetric evaluation of frontal lobe neurodegeneration and can be used as a resource for larger comparative studies as well as a validation procedure of automated algorithms.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDThe first aim of this study was the development of performance metrics in a virtual reality simulation for interventional procedure in a real case of multivessel coronary disease. A second aim was to assess the construct validity of these metrics by comparing the performance of interventional cardiologists with different levels of experience.METHODSNinety-four practicing interventional cardiologists attending the EuroPCR 2005 in Paris, France participated in this study. Complete data was available on eighty-nine participants (95%). Participants were divided into three categories depending on experience. Group 1 (novices): N = 33, 50 cases per year for the last two years and Group 3 (master physicians): N = 42 participants completed > 100 cases per year during the last five years.PROCEDUREOver a period of months during 2004-2005 we identified potential performance metrics for cases of coronary artery disease which were then applied to a case of a patient admitted because of stable angina (class 1) with multivessel coronary disease. Patient's coronary anatomy and lesions were then reconstructed and implemented for the VIST virtual reality simulator. All participants were required to perform this case.RESULTSOverall, experienced interventional cardiologists performed significantly better than the novices for traditional metrics such as time (p = 0.03), contrast fluid (p = 0.0008) and Fluroscopy time (p = 0.005). Master physicians performed significantly better than the other two groups on metrics which assessed technical performance e.g., time to ascend the aorta (p = 0.0004) and stent placement accuracy (p = 0.02). Furthermore, master physicians made fewer handling errors than the intermediated group who in turn made fewer than the novice group (p = 0.0003). Performance consistency was also a linear function of experience.CONCLUSIONSNovel performance metrics developed for the assessment of technical skills for a simulated intervention for multi-vessel coronary disease showed that more experienced interventional cardiologists performed the procedure better than less experienced interventionalists thus demonstrating construct validity of the metrics.},

abstract={The magnetorheological (MR) shock absorber is one of the most promising new devices for vibration reduction. Many investigations have been carried out on low velocity and frequency applications of MR devices. The use of the MR shock absorber under impact load is of great interest. The now widely used MR damper models, such as the Bingham model, cannot explain sufficiently the shear thinning behavior under impact loads. However, the Herschel-Bulkley model can be used to explain the same. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the behavior of the MR shock absorber under impact load and to verify the analytical conclusions and experiments. First, some dynamic simulations on the MR shock absorber under impact loads in Matlab and Simulink are carried out. The model describes the dynamic characteristics especially the shear thinning behavior of the shock absorber, based on this model, then analyzes the variations of piston acceleration and back cavity pressure of MR shock absorber at both same and different flow indices. A test rig is developed to test the characteristics of the long-stroke MR shock absorber under impact loads. Comparisons between the simulation and the test results are made to validate our conclusions. The results indicate that the peak acceleration value of the piston rod and the pressure of the back cavity are decided by the peak value and the duration of the impact force. The peak value of the acceleration and the cavity pressure cannot be changed, but the transitional time of the acceleration of the piston and the pressure of the back cavity of MR shock absorber can be controlled by changing the applied current in the electromagnetic coil. MR shock absorbers will be the most promising shock reduction device under an impact environment.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo test whether basic skills acquired on a virtual endoscopic surgery simulator are transferable from virtual reality to physical reality in a comparable training setting.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATAFor surgical training in laparoscopic surgery, new training methods have to be developed that allow surgeons to first practice in a simulated setting before operating on real patients. A virtual endoscopic surgery trainer (VEST) has been developed within the framework of a joint project. Because of principal limitations of simulation techniques, it is essential to know whether training with this simulator is comparable to conventional training.METHODSDevices used were the VEST system and a conventional video trainer (CVT). Two basic training tasks were constructed identically (a) as virtual tasks and (b) as mechanical models for the CVT. Test persons were divided into 2 groups each consisting of 12 novices and 4 experts. Each group carried out a defined training program over the course of 4 consecutive days on the VEST or the CVT, respectively. To test the transfer of skills, the groups switched devices on the 5th day. The main parameter was task completion time.RESULTSThe novices in both groups showed similar learning curves. The mean task completion times decreased significantly over the 4 training days of the study. The task completion times for the control task on Day 5 were significantly lower than on Days 1 and 2. The experts' task completion times were much lower than those of the novices.CONCLUSIONSThis study showed that training with a computer simulator, just as with the CVT, resulted in a reproducible training effect. The control task showed that skills learned in virtual reality are transferable to the physical reality of a CVT. The fact that the experts showed little improvement demonstrates that the simulation trains surgeons in basic laparoscopic skills learned in years of practice.},

abstract={Minimal access surgery (MAS) requires additional training in the surgical curriculum, as skills needed to perform MAS are quite different from those used in open surgery. Moreover, residents do not seem to experience ample opportunity to gain such skills in the current surgical curriculum. Virtual reality (VR) simulation offers an interesting opportunity to train such skills in a safe, supporting environment. As with any new development, one should be careful about integrating costly technology into practice before it has been properly validated.This article outlines the requirements for a valid and integrated approach towards the integration of novel VR simulation systems in minimal access surgery.},

abstract={Current minimally invasive techniques for beating heart surgery are associated with three major limitations: the shortage of realistic and safe training methods, the process of selecting port locations for optimal target coverage from X-rays and angiograms, and the sole use of the endoscope for instrument navigation in a dynamic and confined 3D environment. To supplement the current surgery training, planning and guidance methods, we continue to develop our Virtual Cardiac Surgery Planning environment (VCSP) -- a virtual reality, patient-specific, thoracic cavity model derived from 3D pre-procedural images. In this work, we create and validate dynamic models of the heart and its components. A static model is first generated by segmenting one of the image frames in a given 4D data set. The dynamics of this model are then extracted from the remaining image frames using a non-linear, intensity-based registration algorithm with a choice of six different similarity metrics. The algorithm is validated on an artificial CT image set created using an excised porcine heart, on CT images of canine subjects, and on MR images of human volunteers. We found that with the appropriate choice of similarity metric, our algorithm extracts the motion of the epicardial surface in CT images, or of the myocardium, right atrium, right ventricle, aorta, left atrium, pulmonary arteries, vena cava and epicardial surface in MR images, with a root mean square error in the 1 mm range. These results indicate that our method of modeling the motion of the heart is easily adaptable and sufficiently accurate to meet the requirements for reliable cardiac surgery training, planning, and guidance.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo develop a software for virtual reality (VR) simulation of X-ray images based on perspective projections through a patient model derived from data from a CT examination and to evaluate the accuracy in the projection geometry obtained by the software.METHODSA VR software was developed on a personal computer, with models of a patient, an X-ray machine and a detector. The model of the patient was derived from data from a CT examination of a dry skull. Simulated radiographic images of the patient model could be rendered as perspective projections based on the relative positions between the models. The projection geometry of the software was validated by developing an artificial CT data set containing high attenuation points as objects to be imaged. The accuracy in projection geometry was evaluated in a systematic way. The distances between two dots, representing the projected test points in the simulated radiographic images, were measured. They were compared with theoretical calculations of the corresponding distances using traditional mathematical tools.RESULTSThe difference between the simulated and calculated projected distances never exceeded 0.5 mm. The error in simulated projected distances was in most cases within 1%. No systematic errors were revealed.CONCLUSIONThe software, developed for personal computers, can produce simulated X-ray images with high geometric accuracy based on perspective projections through a CT data set. The software can be used for simulation of radiographic examinations.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDInhalation of endotoxin may enhance inflammatory airway response in sensitized asthmatics persons after allergen(s) inhalation.OBJECTIVETo evaluate nasal response to intranasal instillation of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), endotoxin (LPS), and to Dp+LPS in children with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR).METHODS10 PAR children (positive skin prick test to Dp) and 10 nonallergic controls (C) undergoing nasal provocation test (NPT), who were quantified by active anterior rhinomanometry and measurement of Total Nasal Resistance (TNR). The NPTs were initially performed with histamine (H; 0.03 to 16.0 mg/mL), and then, at least at weekly intervals, the NPTs were done with Dp (1/100,000 to 1/2.5), LPS (1 to 500 mg/mL) and to Dp+LPS. During NPT with Dp+LPS, Dp concentration was kept constant (1/100,000; 1/10,000; 1/1,000) and was combined with different concentrations of LPS (1, 5, 10, 20 mg/mL). The NPT was considered positive when TNR reached twice the basal TNR.RESULTSH and Dp NPTs were positive in all AR children. In group C, H NPT was positive in 60% and Dp NPT was negative in all children. NPT with LPS was positive only in 30% of the AR children. NPT with Dp+LPS was positive in 90% of the AR patients in Dp concentration of 1/1,000 and in LPS concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mcg/ mL. This positive association was observed with Dp concentrations lower than those obtained during NPT with Dp in 60% of AR patients. There were no changes in pulmonary function tests in all children after NPT.CONCLUSIONSThis study suggests that LPS enhances the effects of allergen challenges on nasal airflow. The daily inhalation of allergens plus endotoxin in AR patients does increase the nasal responsiveness.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo establish the construct validity of a virtual reality-based upper gastrointestinal endoscopy simulator as a tool for the skills training of residents.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATAPrevious studies have demonstrated the relevance of virtual reality training as an adjunct to traditional operating room learning for residents. The use of specific task trainers, which have the ability to objectively analyze and track user performance, has been shown to demonstrate improvements in performance over time. Using this off-line technology can lessen the financial and ethical concerns of using operative time to teach basic skills.METHODSThirty-five residents and fellows from General Surgery and Gastrointestinal Medicine were recruited for this study. Their performance on virtual reality upper endoscopy tasks was analyzed by computer. Assessments were made on parameters such as time needed to finish the examination, completeness of the examination, and number of wall collisions. Subjective experiences were queried through questionnaires. Users were grouped according to their prior level of experience performing endoscopy.RESULTSConstruct validation of this simulator was demonstrated. Performance on visualization and biopsy tasks varied directly with the subjects' prior experience level. Subjective responses indicated that novice and intermediate users felt the simulation to be a useful experience, and that they would use the equipment in their off time if it were available.CONCLUSIONSVirtual reality simulation may be a useful adjunct to traditional operating room experiences. Construct validity testing demonstrates the efficacy of this device. Similar objective methods of skills evaluation may be useful as part of a residency skills curriculum and as a means of procedural skills testing.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDThe study was carried out to analyze the learning rate for laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality training system and to establish whether the simulator was able to differentiate between surgeons with different laparoscopic experience.METHODSForty-one surgeons were divided into three groups according to their experience in laparoscopic surgery: masters (group 1, performed more than 100 cholecystectomies), intermediates (group 2, between 15 and 80 cholecystectomies), and beginners (group 3, fewer than 10 cholecystectomies) were included in the study. The participants were tested on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) 10 consecutive times within a 1-month period. Assessment of laparoscopic skills included time, errors, and economy of hand movement, measured by the simulator.RESULTSThe learning curves regarding time reached plateau after the second repetition for group 1, the fifth repetition for group 2, and the seventh repetition for group 3 (Friedman's tests P 0.2) indicating the absence of a learning curve for these parameters. Group 2 error scores reached plateau after the first repetition, and group 3 after the fifth repetition. Group 2 improved their economy of movement score up to the third repetition and group 3 up to the sixth repetition (Friedman's tests, P <0.05). Experienced surgeons (group 1) demonstrated best performance parameters, followed by group 2 and group 3 (Mann-Whitney test P <0.05).CONCLUSIONSDifferent learning curves existed for surgeons with different laparoscopic background. The familiarization rate on the simulator was proportional to the operative experience of the surgeons. Experienced surgeons demonstrated best laparoscopic performance on the simulator, followed by those with intermediate experience and the beginners. These differences indicate that the scoring system of MIST-VR is sensitive and specific to measuring skills relevant for laparoscopic surgery.},

abstract={PURPOSESurgical simulation has emerged in the last decade as a potential tool for aiding acquisition of technical skills, including anesthesia protocols, trauma management, cardiac catheterization and laparoscopy. We evaluate and validate the use of a computer based ureteroscopy simulator (URO Mentor, Simbionix Ltd., Lod, Israel) in the acquisition of basic ureteroscopic skills.MATERIALS AND METHODSWe assessed 20 novice trainees for the ability to perform basic ureteroscopic tasks on a computer based ureteroscopy simulator. Participants were randomized to receive individualized mentored instruction or no additional training, and subsequently underwent post-testing. Pre-training and post-training improvement in performance was assessed by objective simulator based measurements. Subjective overall performance was rated using a validated endourological global rating scale by an observer blinded to subject training status.RESULTSDemographics and pre-test scores were similar between groups. Post-testing revealed a significant effect of training on objective and subjective measurements. Spearman rank correlation demonstrated a significant association between objective simulator based measurements and the endourological global rating scale.CONCLUSIONSUse of a computer based ureteroscopy simulator resulted in rapid acquisition of ureteroscopic skills in trainees with no prior surgical training. Results of this study demonstrate the use of a virtual reality ureteroscopy simulator in endourological training. Correlation of simulator based measurements with a previously validated endourological global rating scale provides initial validation of the ureteroscopy simulator for the assessment of ureteroscopic skills.},

abstract={Hydrogen concentration in austenitic stainless steel irradiated with neutrons in boiling water reactors (BWRs) was measured and the effect of hydrogen in the austenitic stainless steel on intergranular cracking was investigated by the slow strain rate test (SSRT) in Ar gas. The hydrogen concentration decreased at low neutron fluences and increased at high neutron fluences. The decrease was attributed to the effect of heating or gamma -ray irradiation at the early stage of reactor operation. The increase at high fluences was considered mainly due to the generation of hydrogen by nuclear transmutation. Intergranular cracking was not found for the specimen irradiated to a high fluence (1.4mult10 exp 26 n/m exp 2 ) in the SSRT at a very low strain rate (1.0mult10 exp -8 s exp -1 ). This meant that the hydrogen concentration was too small to induce cracking, or hydrogen could not diffuse because of being trapped in irradiation defects at the test temperature.
