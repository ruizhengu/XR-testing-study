abstract={Gliomas exhibit high intra-tumoral histological and molecular heterogeneity. Introducing stereotactic biopsy, we achieved a superior molecular analysis of glioma using O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). Patients underwent simultaneous DWI and FET-PET scans. Correlations between biopsy-derived tumor tissue values, such as the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)/exponential ADC (eADC) and histopathological diagnoses and those between relevant genes and TBR and ADC values were determined. Tumor regions with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mutation had higher TBR and lower ADC values. Tumor protein P53 mutation correlated with lower TBR and higher ADC values. α-thalassemia/mental-retardation-syndrome-X-linked gene (ATRX) correlated with higher ADC values. 1p/19q codeletion and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations correlated with lower ADC values. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations correlated with higher TBRmean values. No correlation existed between TBRmax/TBRmean/ADC/eADC values and phosphatase and tensin homolog mutations (PTEN) or O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Furthermore, TBR/ADC combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than each single imaging method for high-grade and IDH1-, hTERT-, and EGFR-mutated gliomas. This is the first study establishing the accurate diagnostic criteria for glioma based on FET-PET and DWI.},

abstract={OBJECTIVESTo compare outcomes and cost-effectiveness of various initial imaging strategies in the management of stable chest pain in a long-term prospective randomised trial.SETTINGRegional cardiothoracic referral centre in the east of England.PARTICIPANTS898 patients (69% man) entered the study with 869 alive at 2 years of follow-up. Patients were included if they presented for assessment of stable chest pain with a positive exercise test and no prior history of ischaemic heart disease. Exclusion criteria were recent infarction, unstable symptoms or any contraindication to stress MRI.PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcomes of this follow-up study were survival up to a minimum of 2 years post-treatment, quality-adjusted survival and cost-utility of each strategy.RESULTS898 patients were randomised. Compared with angiography, mortality was marginally higher in the groups randomised to cardiac MR (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.2), but similar in the single photon emission CT-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (SPECT-MIBI; HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.9) and ECHO groups (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.6 to 4.0). Although SPECT-MIBI was marginally superior to other non-invasive tests there were no other significant differences between the groups in mortality, quality-adjusted survival or costs.CONCLUSIONSNon-invasive cardiac imaging can be used safely as the initial diagnostic test to diagnose coronary artery disease without adverse effects on patient outcomes or increased costs, relative to angiography. These results should be interpreted in the context of recent advances in imaging technology.TRIAL REGISTRATIONISRCTN 47108462, UKCRN 3696.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to highlight a validation action of virtual reality simulation to integrating health and safety right from design stage. We demonstrate first how simulations using virtual reality techniques help to narrow the area of uncertainty between two viewpoints: that of the work equipment 'designer', who focuses on production constraints with respect to a prescribed task, and that of the end-user, who has to satisfy production constraints in relation to the resources at his disposal (personal, technical and organisational). We then introduce the method retained for validating these simulations. This focuses on the possibility of reproducing a reference activity through simulation. We distinguish two types of simulation validity: internal validity, which is based on the simulator's capacity to reproduce a task (a succession of simple operations), and external validity, which refers to the possibility of simulating activities comparable to those observed in real situations. The results presented concern mainly internal validity.},

abstract={PURPOSETo examine whether the signal intensity of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is altered by test injection of 1 ml of contrast medium, and if so, whether this change affects the DCE-MRI analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODSSix healthy volunteers were examined by DCE-MRI using a Magnevist syringe and/or an Omniscan syringe for the injection of contrast medium. Each scan was performed 10 times using steady-state free precession (3D-FISP), a sequence for DCE-MRI, before and after intravenous injection of 1 ml of the contrast medium. The internal pterygoid muscle, masseter muscle, tongue, parotid gland, submandibular gland, bone marrow of the mandible, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and common carotid artery were determined to be regions of interest (ROI), and the ROI internal average signal intensity was measured. The 10 data sets obtained before or after contrast medium administration for each ROI were evaluated using the paired t-test.RESULTSThe test injection increased the signal intensities of six of eight ROIs, with all 20 experiments in the submandibular gland showing significant differences. There was no significant difference in the two ROIs corresponding to the carotid artery and subcutaneous adipose tissue of the cheek.CONCLUSIONSThe enhanced signal intensity in the tissue might have been caused by the small amount of contrast medium in the test injection. To eliminate this discrepancy caused by the test injection, a pre-contrast scan should be performed when the average signal intensity of an ROI is measured. We therefore believe that the data obtained before a test injection may be important in the analysis of DCE-MRI.},

abstract={OBJECTIVENoninvasive in vivo hepatic phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy has recently been shown to provide information about hepatic functional status. We sought to show the correlation of phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy with blood biochemistry and liver biopsy results in pediatric patients after liver transplantation.MATERIALS AND METHODSEleven pediatric transplant recipients (eight with good graft function, two with chronic hepatitis, and one with acute rejection) and four healthy control subjects were studied with in vivo 31P MR spectroscopy. Ratios of phosphomonoesters (PME) to total phosphorus (TP), phosphodiester (PDE) to TP, nucleotide triphosphates (NTP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular acid-base status (pH) were measured. Liver function test (n = 11) and biopsy (n = 3) results were obtained for correlation with spectroscopic findings.RESULTSThe eight patients with good graft function displayed spectral profiles similar to those of the healthy subjects, and no significant difference in the metabolic ratios of these patients compared with the control subjects was detected. Three patients with abnormal liver function and biopsy-proven hepatic complications showed elevated PME/TP ratios when compared with those of both the control subjects and the group with good graft function.CONCLUSIONPhosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy is a feasible technique for the noninvasive assessment of host-related complications in pediatric patients after liver transplantation. Our preliminary data suggest that the technique may be integrated with MRI for the investigation of impaired liver function in transplant recipients when neither a biliary complication nor a vascular complication is identified.},

abstract={We report a case of presumed vacuolating megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy (VML) in a 5-year-old boy that was diagnosed when the patient was 34 months old. The patient presented clinically with megalencephaly and delayed onset of slowly progressive neurologic dysfunction. Serial MR imaging and biochemical analysis were performed to differentiate VML from other disease entities with megalencephaly and leukoencephalopathy of infantile onset. Information obtained with diffusion tensor MR imaging revealed nearly intact white matter anisotropy and vectors in parietal and posterior temporal lobes in which hyperintense abnormality was shown on conventional T2-weighted images, and proton MR spectra showed a significant decrease in n-acetylaspartate-creatine + phosphocreatine ratio.},

abstract={PURPOSETo compare the total direct costs (fixed and variable costs) of functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and of the Wada test for evaluation of language lateralization.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe direct fixed and variable costs of functional MR imaging (performed in 21 patients with mean age +/- SD of 15.5 years +/- 8.9) and of the Wada test (performed in 18 patients aged 19.2 years +/- 5.4) were determined prospectively with time and motion analyses. The labor of all personnel involved in evaluations of language lateralization was tracked, and involvement times were recorded to the nearest minute. All material items used in the studies were recorded. Costs of labor and of materials were determined from personnel reimbursement data and from vendor pricing, respectively. Direct fixed costs were determined from hospital accounting department records. Means (+/- SDs) were calculated for all direct fixed and variable costs. Total direct costs were determined for each procedure and compared by using the Student t test.RESULTSThe total direct costs of the Wada test (US dollars 1130.01 +/- US dollars 138.40) and of functional MR imaging (US dollars 301.82 +/- US dollars 10.65) were significantly different (P <.001). The cost of the Wada test was 3.7 times higher than that of functional MR imaging.CONCLUSIONSubstantial savings are achievable with the use of functional MR imaging instead of the Wada test to evaluate language lateralization.},

abstract={PURPOSETo validate fast magnetic resonance (MR) flow mapping with intravascular Doppler flow measurements in vitro and in patients with nonstenotic and stenotic coronary artery bypass grafts.MATERIALS AND METHODSMR and Doppler flow measurements were performed in a small-diameter flow phantom with physiologic flow conditions and at baseline and during adenosine stress in 27 grafts in 23 patients, who were scheduled for cardiac catheterization. At invasive analysis, the grafts were divided into those with stenosis of less than 50% (nonstenotic) and those with stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (stenotic). In vitro velocity values and velocity values in nonstenotic and stenotic grafts were compared with linear regression analysis, and the in vitro interstudy variability was determined.RESULTSExcellent correlations in average peak velocity (r = 0.99, P <.001) and diastolic peak velocity (r = 0.99, P <.001) were demonstrated in vitro between MR and Doppler flow measurements, with less than 5% interstudy variability. MR and Doppler flow measurements revealed good correlations in peak velocity and velocity reserve both in nonstenotic (n = 20) (average peak velocity: r = 0.81, P <.001; diastolic peak velocity: r = 0.83, P <.001; velocity reserve: r = 0.56, P =.010) and stenotic (n = 7) (average peak velocity: r = 0.83, P <.001; diastolic peak velocity: r = 0.78, P =.001; velocity reserve: r = 0.70, P =.078) grafts.CONCLUSIONFast MR flow mapping provides noninvasive measures of peak velocity and velocity reserve, which closely correlate with Doppler values both in vitro and in nonstenotic and stenotic grafts.},
