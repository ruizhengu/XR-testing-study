abstract={OBJECTIVESTo externally validate and assess the accuracy of a previously trained fully automatic nnU-Net CNN algorithm to identify and segment primary neuroblastoma tumors in MR images in a large children cohort.METHODSAn international multicenter, multivendor imaging repository of patients with neuroblastic tumors was used to validate the performance of a trained Machine Learning (ML) tool to identify and delineate primary neuroblastoma tumors. The dataset was heterogeneous and completely independent from the one used to train and tune the model, consisting of 300 children with neuroblastic tumors having 535 MR T2-weighted sequences (486 sequences at diagnosis and 49 after finalization of the first phase of chemotherapy). The automatic segmentation algorithm was based on a nnU-Net architecture developed within the PRIMAGE project. For comparison, the segmentation masks were manually edited by an expert radiologist, and the time for the manual editing was recorded. Different overlaps and spatial metrics were calculated to compare both masks.RESULTSThe median Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was high 0.997; 0.944-1.000 (median; Q1-Q3). In 18 MR sequences (6%), the net was not able neither to identify nor segment the tumor. No differences were found regarding the MR magnetic field, type of T2 sequence, or tumor location. No significant differences in the performance of the net were found in patients with an MR performed after chemotherapy. The time for visual inspection of the generated masks was 7.9 ± 7.5 (mean ± Standard Deviation (SD)) seconds. Those cases where manual editing was needed (136 masks) required 124 ± 120 s.CONCLUSIONSThe automatic CNN was able to locate and segment the primary tumor on the T2-weighted images in 94% of cases. There was an extremely high agreement between the automatic tool and the manually edited masks. This is the first study to validate an automatic segmentation model for neuroblastic tumor identification and segmentation with body MR images. The semi-automatic approach with minor manual editing of the deep learning segmentation increases the radiologist's confidence in the solution with a minor workload for the radiologist.},

abstract={There are limited experimental data on VHCF for structural steels for >107 cycles. Unalloyed low-carbon steel S275JR+AR is a common structural material for the heavy machinery in minerals, sand and aggregate applications. The purpose of this research is to investigate the fatigue behaviour in the gigacycle domain (>109 cycles) for S275JR+AR grade steel. This is achieved using accelerated ultrasonic fatigue testing in as-manufactured, pre-corroded and non-zero mean stress conditions. As internal heat generation is a massive challenge for ultrasonic fatigue testing of structural steels which exhibit a pronounced frequency effect, effective temperature control is crucial for implementation of testing. The frequency effect is assessed by comparing the test data at 20 kHz and 15-20 Hz. Its contribution is significant, as there is no overlap between the stress ranges of interest. The obtained data are intended to be applied to the fatigue assessments of the equipment operating at the frequency for up to 1010 cycles over years of continuous service.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDTo date, the vast majority of research on disordered eating symptomatology and body image disturbances from the Arab world have been performed exclusively among women; and mainly used thinness-oriented measures that are not sensitive to detect muscularity-oriented symptoms, which are more evident in males. Therefore, the objective of our study was to validate the Arabic version of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (Ar-MDDI), in order to make it accessible for Arabic-speaking populations.METHODSUsing a snowball sampling technique, men university students (n = 396) from multiple universities in Lebanon filled the survey in this cross-sectional designed study (January-May 2022). A soft copy of the questionnaire was created using google forms software, and sent to participants through the different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We used the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory to assess Muscle Dysmorphia, along with the Big Three Perfectionism Scale to assess perfectionism and Eating Attitude Test (EAT) to evaluate the inappropriate eating attitudes. To explore the factor structure of Ar-MDDI, we computed a principal-axis Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with the first split-half subsample using the FACTOR software. We used data from the second split-half to conduct a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using the SPSS AMOS v.29 software. Pearson correlation test was used to test the convergent and divergent validity of the Ar-MDDI scale with the other scores included in the study.RESULTSThe results of the EFA revealed three factors, which explained 57.68% of the common variance: Factor 1 = Appearance intolerance, Factor 2 = Drive for size, and Factor 3 = Functional impairment. The CFA fit indices of the three-factor model of the Ar-MDDI scale showed good results. Moreover, 254 (64.1%) of the participants had inappropriate eating attitudes (EAT scores ≥ 20). Indices suggested that configural, metric, and scalar invariance was supported according to eating attitudes. No significant difference between participants with appropriate versus inappropriate eating attitudes in terms of functional impairment, drive for size and appearance intolerance. Perfectionism scores correlated positively with the Ar-MDDI, which suggests divergent validity.CONCLUSIONOur findings revealed that the validation of the Arabic scale yielded excellent properties, preliminarily supporting its use for the assessment of muscle dysmorphia among Arabic-speaking university men. This would hopefully allow for its timely detection and management in Arab clinical settings and encourage cross-cultural research on this topic.},

abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively used as a tool to map the brain processes related to somatosensory stimulation. This mapping includes the localization of task-related brain activation and the characterization of brain activity dynamics and neural circuitries related to the processing of somatosensory information. However, the magnetic resonance (MR) environment presents unique challenges regarding participant and equipment safety and compatibility. This study aims to systematically review and analyze the state-of-the-art methodologies to assess the safety and compatibility of somatosensory stimulation devices in the MR environment. A literature search, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines, was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to find original research on the development and testing of devices for somatosensory stimulation in the MR environment. Nineteen records that complied with the inclusion and eligibility criteria were considered. The findings are discussed in the context of the existing international standards available for the safety and compatibility assessment of devices intended to be used in the MR environment. In sum, the results provided evidence for a lack of uniformity in the applied testing methodologies, as well as an in-depth presentation of the testing methodologies and results. Lastly, we suggest an assessment methodology (safety, compatibility, performance, and user acceptability) that can be applied to devices intended to be used in the MR environment.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42021257838.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDAllergic rhinitis (AR) is frequent in children and adolescents and can severely affect their lives. This article describes the development and validation of a questionnaire to assess treatment needs and benefits in children and adolescents, the PBI-AR-K, in a sample of patients receiving grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODSThe PBI-AR-K was developed based on an open survey including children and adolescents and expert consensus between methodologists, patients, and physicians. The PBI-AR-K assesses patient needs before the treatment and perceived benefit during or at the end of a treatment. A weighted benefit score can be calculated ranging from 0 to 4 (4 = highest possible benefit). The validation was conducted in children (5-12 years) and adolescents (13-17 years) receiving sublingual immunotherapy. Subscales were developed based on factor analysis. Psychometric properties of items and scales were assessed with descriptive statistics, internal consistency, and convergent validity.RESULTSThe final PBI-AR-K consists of 19 items. For validation, data from 345 patients (mean age 11.1; 60.9% male; n = 223 children; n = 122 adolescents) was analysed. Factor analyses resulted in four subscales for children and three subscales for adolescents. The items with the highest importance ratings were about choice of leisure activities (mean value in children: 3.5) and about being free of AR symptoms (adolescents: 3.3). The weighted PBI-AR-K scores reflected considerable patient-reported benefit (2.08-2.82) in both children and adolescents. Internal consistency of all scales was good or acceptable. In the children's sample, the global scale and three of four subscales were quite consistently correlated with convergent variables, while the subscale 'treatment burden' was significantly correlated only with change in average impairments due to rhinitis symptoms. The adolescents' sample showed more inconsistent results with only change in rhinitis severity being significantly associate with all subscales.CONCLUSIONThe newly developed PBI-AR-K is a reliable and valid questionnaire for use in children; for the use in adolescents, it should be further elaborated.},

abstract={Background Physical therapy education benefits from innovative and authentic learning opportunities. However, factors that influence the acceptance of educational technology must be assessed prior to curricular adoption. The purpose of this study was to assess the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of a virtual reality (VR) learning experience developed to promote the clinical decision-making of student physical therapists. Methods A VR learning experience was developed, and an established two-stage usability test assessed player experience as well as the user’s perception of both ease of use and usefulness. Two experts evaluated the VR learning experience and provided feedback. Six student physical therapists and five faculty members completed the VR experience, responded to two questionnaires, and participated in a semi-structured interview to further assess ease of use and utility. Results High levels of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and positive player experiences were reported by both faculty and student users. Faculty users perceived a significantly greater amount of educational and clinical utility from the VR simulation than did student users. Semi-structured interviews revealed themes related to ease of use, benefits, modeling of professional behaviors, and realism. Conclusion Quantitative data supported faculty and student users’ perceptions of ease of use, utility towards learning, practical application, and several constructs related to user experience. Qualitative data provided recommendations to modify design features of the VR experience. This study provides a template to design, produce, and assess the usability of an immersive VR learning experience that may be replicated by other health professions educators where current evidence is limited.},

abstract={Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is gradually replacing traditional open surgery. Novices need a lot of practice in the surgical simulator to master surgical skills. Therefore, this paper developed an extended reality-based minimally invasive surgery (MIS-XR) simulator, which includes VR, AR and IVR simulators, and introduces the traditional Box simulator to compare these four simulators. Twenty-two subjects were divided into the expert group (6) and novice group (16) and were invited to participate in the experiment. Face, content, and construct validation methods were used to evaluate the tactile sense, visual sense, scene authenticity, and performance of the four simulators. The cumulative summation was used to further analyze the learning curve of 30 times training for the novice group, to verify the effectiveness of the four simulators and determine which simulator can improve the operator’s surgical skills more quickly. The results of the face and content validation show that the Box simulator is the strongest among the four simulators in the tactile sense, IVR simulator is superior to the Box simulator and VR simulator in scene authenticity. The result of construction validation shows that the four simulators are not only useful in improving the surgical skills of novices but also retain the surgical skills after a period of rest. The MIS-XR simulator developed in this paper is effective and can be used as a training device of surgical skills for novices.},

abstract={Although many studies have developed indoor streetscape audit instruments, given the limitation of conventional image information, these have merely been optimized for auditing objective elements of a street. Against this backdrop, this study ascertains whether omnidirectional videos and fully immersive virtual experiences using head-mount displays can be applied to audit the subjective streetscape qualities, thereby replacing the field audit. The study conducts a series of experiments (test audits) using street view images, 360 VR video, and field experience, comparing them using quantitative and qualitative approaches. The results show that VR audit generates results more consistent with the field audit than the street view based audit. In particular, 360 VR video is appropriate for auditing items related to the sense of space, behavioral qualities, and overall street atmosphere. This result unveils the possibility of a recorded VR-based visual assessment survey as a new indoor audit method for evaluating the quality of urban design, which is rarely addressed in existing streetscape audit tools due to its high subjectivity. However, intra-rater agreement estimates of a VR audit demonstrate that its reproducibility remains unreliable. Moreover, a VR audit is less cost-effective than other methods and is not adequate for auditing items that require sensory experience other than the audiovisual. Thus, even if a VR audit can replace much of the streetscape audit, the need for on-site experience remains unlikely to be replaced.},

abstract={Today, with the rapid development of virtual reality technology, 3D printing technology has gradually gained people's attention. Copper alloy parts have a wide range of uses in our lives, but due to the high technology required, production is more difficult. In order to make copper alloy parts more widely used, this paper uses 3D printing technology to print copper alloy parts, and through comparative experiments, the printed copper alloy parts are analyzed in detail. In the printing process, by adjusting the printing parameters, different parts are printed, and the printing results are analyzed for different parameters. The experimental results show that the experimental 3D printing technology can successfully print copper alloy parts. During the printing process, the input parameters have an extremely important effect on the results. The experimental results show that there are related parameters in the printing process, such as layer height, length, density, etc., which will cause deviations in the printing results. Among them, the layer height and length have the most important effect on the results, accounting for more than 50% of the deviation value. This shows that based on virtual reality technology, the use of 3D printing copper alloy parts is achievable.},

abstract={ObjectiveTranslations and adaptations of traditional neuropsychological tests to virtual reality (VR) technology bear the potential to increase their ecological validity since the technology enables simulating everyday life conditions in a controlled manner. The current paper describes our translation of a commonly used neuropsychological test to VR, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). For this aim, we developed a VR adaptation of the RAVLT (VR-RAVLT) Which is based on a conversation with a secretary in a virtual office using a fully immersive VR system. To validate the VR-RAVLT, we tested its construct validity, its age-related discriminant validity and its test-retest validity in reference to the original gold standard RAVLT (GS-RAVLT).MethodSeventy-eight participants from different age groups performed the GS-RAVLT and the VR-RAVLT tests in a counterbalanced order in addition to other neuropsychological tests. Construct validity was validated using Pearson's correlations coefficients and serial position effects; discriminant validity was validated using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values and test-retest reliability was validated using intraclass correlation coefficients.ResultsComparing both RAVLTs' format results indicates that the VR-RAVLT has comparable construct, discriminant and test-retest validities.Conclusionthe novel VR-RAVLT and the GS-RAVLT share similar psychometric properties suggesting that the two tests measure the same cognitive construct. This is an indication of the feasibility of adapting the RAVLT to the VR environment. Future developments will employ this approach for clinical diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract={When a car is operating, the road roughness will cause it to vibrate. When this vibration reaches a particular threshold, the driver will get uncomfortable and fatigued, affecting the bearing system’s durability and longevity. The vehicle vibration virtual test system’s framework design and implementation approach is based on virtual reality (VR), and it is made up of a VR subsystem, a model subsystem, and a virtual instrument subsystem. A virtual car vibration test system based on VR is built, and the results of the virtual vehicle vibration test are reported. The findings indicate that the virtual test (VT) technology theoretical model pertains to the creation of VT systems for car vibration based on VR. Users may monitor the vehicle vibration as well as its time domain and frequency domain signals in three separate observation modes using the system.},

abstract={Scenario-based proving ground testing has been established as the standard test environment for the homologation of driver assistance systems. These test procedures are described, for example, in the New Car Assessment Programme test catalog, which only considers a limited number of possible scenarios. Furthermore, pedestrian targets are, among others, used to test assistance systems for protection against vulnerable road users (VRUs). However, these targets also have the disadvantage that they only represent humans in a simplified way and cannot depict realistic movement patterns. On the other hand, simulation has been established as an efficient means of realizing scenarios in a reproducible, time- and cost-saving manner. However, simulation has a major disadvantage: it can only represent reality to a limited extent, e.g., in the influence of human factors in response to hazardous situations. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world testing, we introduce MiRE, a mixed reality environment for testing automated driving functions. In MiRE, real entities meet in a virtual environment and take advantage of real and simulated test procedures. This paper presents MiRE, a proof of concept based on a modular architecture. The goal is to use it to evaluate the feasibility of testing in mixed reality – by comparing it to proving ground testing. Preliminary results show that MiRE is a suitable environment for testing complex scenarios where the real vehicle and VRUs can safely interact in safety-critical situations and produce realistic results.},

abstract={INTRODUCTIONTechnology has been a major contributor to recent changes in education, where simulation plays a huge role by providing a unique safe environment, especially with the recent incorporation of immersive virtual reality (VR) training. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is said to double, even triple survival from cardiac arrest, and hence it is crucial to ensure optimal acquisition and retention of these skills. In this study, we aim to compare a VR CPR teaching program to current teaching methods with content validation of the VR course.METHODSA randomized single-blinded simulation-based pilot study where 26 participants underwent baseline assessment of their CPR skills using a validated checklist and Laerdal QCPR®. Participants were randomly allocated and underwent their respective courses. This was followed by a final assessment and a questionnaire for content validation, knowledge and confidence. The data was analysed using STATA 16.2 to determine the standardized mean difference using paired and unpaired t-test.RESULTSSubjective assessment using the checklist showed statistically significant improvement in the overall scores of both groups (traditional group mean improved from 6.92 to 9.61 p-value 0.0005, VR group from 6.61 to 8.53 p-value 0.0016). However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the final scores in both the subjective and objective assessments. As for the questionnaire, knowledge and confidence seemed to improve equally. Finally, the content validation showed statistically significant improvement in ease of use (mean score 3 to 4.23 p-value of 0.0144), while for content, positivity of experience, usefulness and appropriateness participants showed similar satisfaction before and after use.CONCLUSIONThis pilot study suggests that VR teaching could deliver CPR skills in an attractive manner, with no inferiority in acquisition of these skills compared to traditional methods. To corroborate these findings, we suggest a follow-up study with a larger sample size after adding ventilation and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) skills to the VR course with re-examination after 3-6 months to test retention of the skills.},

abstract={The current study tested the effects of a celebrity's virtual reality (VR) video on YouTube on audience transportation, parasocial interaction, identification, worship, and behavioral intention of social campaign participation. In addition to VR effects, fans and nonfans were compared with each other for engagement. The media content of BTS, a Korean pop boy band, was experimented in six groups: VR video with a headset, 360-degree video, 2D video, audio, news article, and control. A posttest only experiment was conducted among 142 participants in total. Results found that the VR with a headset group showed a significant difference from the news article group in transportation into BTS. The VR with a headset group had higher parasocial interaction with BTS than the control group. BTS fans were more likely than nonfans to show significant transportation, parasocial interaction, identification, worship, and behavioral intention.},

abstract={Communicators of charity organizations have begun to adopt virtual reality modality to draw in more donors in recent years. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive theoretical exploration and empirical verification on the avenues that may optimize the function of virtual reality modality for communication conducted by charity organizations. To fill this gap, the current study proposes and validates a framework based on integrative extension of theories pertaining to enactive cognition, media affordances, and personal norm. As the research result suggests, the five immersive affordance attributes of vividness, authenticity, coherence, interactivity, and controllability are primary facilitators of empathy and personal norm activation in the virtual reality context. The type of virtual reality modality, which provides immersive affordance attributes to exercise the transformative change effect, serves to elicit charitable donation intention through evocation of empathy and personal norm activation as the two key mediators. More noteworthy, the positive impact of empathy on charitable donation intention significantly increases due to the partial mediating effect of personal norm activation. Overall, the research result contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of communication conducted by charity organizations.},

abstract={Background: Although prior research has established that freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with anxiety, only one study to date has directly manipulated anxiety levels to induce FOG. Objective: The current study aimed to replicate these previous findings and evaluate whether a seated version of a ‘threat’ virtual reality (VR) paradigm could induce anxiety and provoke FOG. Methods: Twenty-four PD patients with FOG were assessed across various threat conditions in both a walking VR paradigm (Experiment 1) and a seated VR paradigm (Experiment 2). Both paradigms manipulated the height (i.e., elevated vs ground) and width (wide vs narrow) of the planks participants were instructed to walk across. Results: Across both experiments, the Elevated + Narrow condition provoked significantly greater number of freezing episodes compared to all other conditions. Higher levels of self-reported anxiety were reported during the Elevated+Narrow condition compared to all other conditions in Experiment 1, and compared to the Ground condition in Experiment 2. Conclusion: These findings confirm that anxiety contributes to FOG and validates the use of a seated VR threat paradigm for provoking anxiety-related freezing. This enables future studies to combine this paradigm with functional MRI to explore the neural correlates underlying the role of anxiety in FOG.},

abstract={Virtual and augmented reality have seen increasing employment for teaching within medical and health sciences programs. For disciplines such as physiology and anatomy, these technologies may disrupt the traditional modes of teaching and content delivery. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality or augmented reality on knowledge acquisition for students studying preclinical physiology and anatomy. The protocol was submitted to Prospero and literature search undertaken in PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and other databases. Citations were reviewed and articles published in full assessing learning or knowledge acquisition in preclinical physiology and anatomy from virtual or augmented reality were included. Of the 919 records found, 58 eligible articles were reviewed in full-text, with 8 studies meeting full eligibility requirements. There was no significant difference in knowledge scores from combining the eight studies (626 participants), with the pooled difference being a non-significant increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI -2.9; 8.6]). For the four studies comparing virtual reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI -4.1; 15.7]). For the five studies comparing augmented reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.07 (95% CI -7.0; 7.2]). Upon review of the literature, it is apparent that educators could benefit from adopting assessment processes that evaluate three-dimensional spatial understanding as a priority in physiology and anatomy. The overall evidence suggests that although test performance is not significantly enhanced with either mode, both virtual and augmented reality are viable alternatives to traditional methods of education in health sciences and medical courses.},

abstract={As post-secondary education migrates online, developing and evaluating new avenues for assessment in anatomy is paramount. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology is one area with the potential to augment or even replace resource-intensive cadaver use in anatomical education. This manuscript details the development of a smartphone application, entitled "Virtual Reality Bell-Ringer (VRBR)," capable of displaying monoscopic two-dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic 3D images with the use of an inexpensive cardboard headset for use in spot examinations. Cadaveric image use, creation, and pinning processes are explained, and the source code is provided. To validate this tool, this paper compares traditional laboratory-based spot examination assessment stations against those administered using the VRBR application to test anatomical knowledge. Participants (undergraduate, n = 38; graduate, n = 13) completed three spot examinations specific to their level of study, one in each of the modalities (2D, 3D, laboratory) as well as a mental rotation test (MRT), Stereo Fly stereotest, and cybersickness survey. Repeated measures ANCOVA suggested participants performed significantly better on laboratory and 3D stations compared to 2D stations. Moderate to severe cybersickness symptoms were reported by 63% of participants in at least one category while using the VRBR application. Highest reported symptoms included: eye strain, general discomfort, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating. Overall, the VRBR application is a promising tool for its portability, affordability, and accessibility. Due to reported cybersickness and other technical limitations, the use of VRBR as an alternative to cadaveric specimens presents several challenges when testing anatomy knowledge that must be addressed before widespread adoption.},

abstract={The comparability or similarity of consumers’ behavior in virtual reality (VR) and in real life (RL) is indispensable to successfully take advantage of VR technology in consumer behavior (CB) research. This study investigated the comparability of participants’ behavior in a virtual environment and in RL to validate VR for data acquisition in CB research. Participants (N = 98) were randomly assigned to a RL condition or a VR condition in which the settings were chosen to mimic a RL environment as closely as possible. In both conditions, participants ranked 20 types of commercial breakfast cereal by their perceived healthiness from healthy to unhealthy. We observed that the perceived healthiness of the 20 cereals in the VR and RL conditions were highly correlated (rₛ = 0.91, p < .001, N = 20). The information-seeking behavior was not different between the two conditions, t (96) = −1.11, p = .27. Furthermore, the attributes employed by the participants to evaluate the healthiness of the cereals did not vary between the two conditions. The presence level of the participants in the virtual environment was also examined. The results illustrate that the participants’ behavior in the virtual environment and in the real world were comparable, which provides robust evidence for the validity of VR as a beneficial and promising tool for data acquisition in CB research.},

Ten commercial cookies were virtualized by photogrammetry then configured inside virtual sensory booths designed using Unity and presented via a first-version HTC Vive virtual reality headset. Flash profiling was used to determine changes in relative weight of the perceptual dimensions in the product space and compare descriptions of actual vs. virtual product appearance. Conventional profiling of both actual and virtual products then served to determine whether common sensory dimensions carry the same kind of weight in both real and virtual sensory spaces and show similar ranges of difference among products. The results showed that descriptions of virtual cookies were close to descriptions of the actual cookies. Brightness carried more weight in the perceptual space of actual products whereas color contrast carried more weight in the perceptual space of virtual products. However, this difference may have arisen from software-setting configurations that could be optimized for a better match. Taken together, the results of this study offer promising perspectives for the use of virtual products in sensory and consumers studies.},

abstract={A common operation performed in Virtual Reality (VR) environments is locomotion. Although real walking can represent a natural and intuitive way to manage displacements in such environments, its use is generally limited by the size of the area tracked by the VR system (typically, the size of a room) or requires expensive technologies to cover particularly extended settings. A number of approaches have been proposed to enable effective explorations in VR, each characterized by different hardware requirements and costs, and capable to provide different levels of usability and performance. However, the lack of a well-defined methodology for assessing and comparing available approaches makes it difficult to identify, among the various alternatives, the best solutions for selected application domains. To deal with this issue, this article introduces a novel evaluation testbed which, by building on the outcomes of many separate works reported in the literature, aims to support a comprehensive analysis of the considered design space. An experimental protocol for collecting objective and subjective measures is proposed, together with a scoring system able to rank locomotion approaches based on a weighted set of requirements. Testbed usage is illustrated in a use case requesting to select the technique to adopt in a given application scenario.},

abstract={The development of multiple cultural and social related activities, such as shows related with the performing arts, conferences or presentations rely on facilities such as auditoriums, theatres and conference sites, which are progressively including multiple technological features in order to enhance user experience. There are still however situations in which user experience is limited owing to lack of environment adaption, such as people with disabilities. In this sense, the adoption of Context Aware paradigms within auditoriums can provide adequate functionalities in order to comply with specific needs. This work is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility in enhancing user experience (e.g., improving the autonomy of disabled people) within auditorium and theatre environments, by means of an Augmented Reality (AR) device (HoloLens smart glasses) with wireless system integration. To carry out the demonstration, different elements to build AR applications are described and tested. First, an intensive measurement campaign was performed in a real auditorium in the city of Pamplona (Baluarte Congress Center) in order to evaluate the feasibility of using Wi-Fi enabled AR devices in a complex wireless propagation scenario. The results show that these environments exhibit high levels of interference, owing to the co-existence and non-coordinated operation of multiple wireless communication systems, such as on site and temporary Wi-Fi access points, wireless microphones or communications systems used by performers, staff and users. Deterministic wireless channel estimation based in volumetric 3D Ray Launching have been obtained for the complete scenario volume, in order to assess quality of service metrics. For illustration purposes, a user-friendly application to help hearing impaired people was developed and its main features were tested in the auditorium. Such an application provides users with a 3D virtual space to visualize useful multimedia content like subtitles or additional information about the show, as well as an integrated call button.},

abstract={Emerging adulthood is a critical developmental period for examining food- and eating-related behaviors as long-term weight-related behavioral patterns are established. Virtual reality (VR) technology is a promising tool for basic and applied research on eating and food-related processes. Thus, the present study tested the validity and user perceptions of a highly immersive and realistic VR food buffet by: (1) comparing participants' food selections made in the VR buffet and a real-world (RW) food buffet cafeteria one-week apart, and (2) assessing participants' rated perceptions of their VR experience (0–100 scale). Participants comprised an ethnically diverse sample of emerging adults (N = 35, Mₐgₑ = 20.49, SD = 2.17). Results revealed that participants' food selections in the VR and RW food buffets were significantly and positively correlated in Kcals, grams, carbohydrates, and protein (all p's < 0.05). Moreover, participants perceived that: (a) the VR buffet was natural (M = 70.97, SD = 20.92), (b) their lunch selection in the VR buffet represented a lunch they would select on an average day (M = 84.11, SD = 15.92); and (c) their selection represented a lunch they would select if the same foods were available (M = 91.29, SD = 11.00). Our findings demonstrated the validity and acceptability of our highly immersive and realistic VR buffet for assessing food selection that is generalizable to RW food settings one-week apart without precisely matched foods. The findings of this study support the utility of VR as a validated tool for research on psychological and behavioral food-related processes and training interventions among emerging adults.},

The experimental program corresponds to the study of beams, columns, and frames of austenitic stainless steel subjected to different types of static loading. The development of these applications encompasses the use of measured data from sensors, the use of 3D modeling tools, the use of game engines, and the corresponding mathematical treatment and postprocess of the structural tests in a real-time fashion. The developed applications provide new possibilities for structural engineering laboratory experiences. In both cases (VR and AR), the developed applications are meant to enhance the experimental program experience to a variety of target users (researchers, technicians, students) by adding customized information related to the structural behavior of all elements during the tests as well as to basic concepts of health and safety in structural engineering laboratories.},

abstract={In the epilepsy monitoring unit of the Department of Neurology at the University Clinic of Salzburg 20 adult patients were recruited to participate in a validation of 6 parallel versions of the virtual reality test for episodic memory. Patients were tested up to 7 times, i.e. twice a day, in the morning and evening, beginning on Monday evening. Each session consisted of learning a new town and immediate recall for this town. All sessions but the first one included also delayed recall of the previously learned town and a recognition test. Recall included the sub-scales what, details, when, egocentric where and allocentric where. Recognition memory was tested by presenting the patients 30 sentences of which 15 were true and 15 were false.While not all patients completed the full testing schedule, at immediate recall for 9 patients a full data set (7 sessions) is available. All patients were free of antiepileptic medication (N = 19) or medication was kept constant across the week (N = 1).This data can be used to demonstrate the feasibility to use the virtual reality test in the epilepsy monitoring unit e.g. to monitor effects of seizures or medication on episodic memory.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEThe aims of the present study were twofold: 1) to examine the effects of a virtual reality version of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR) using a placebo as the control condition; 2) to delineate sex differences in psychophysiological responses following the TSST-VR.METHODSHealthy young male (n = 30) and female (n = 30) undergraduates were randomly assigned to a psychosocial stress protocol condition or to a non-stressful control condition (placebo) also under virtual reality environment (VR). Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured throughout the condition. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the perceived stress before and after the condition. We also included subjective scales of emotional states and coping.RESULTSDifferent ANOVAs showed that after VR, the stress group reported higher scores on VAS than the non-stress group. Before VR, compared with females, the males showed stronger EDA and higher HRV. Under VR, the males had lower HR. After VR, the males' HR was still lower than females', but their HRV was higher than females'. Finally, the correlation between subjective and objective reactivity demonstrated that HRV during the experiment was negatively correlated to depression and negative affect. The HRV after VR was negatively correlated to the positive coping but was positively correlated to the depression.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest that the TSST-VR could be used as an available tool for testing sex differences to psychosocial stress induction in experimental settings. Compared with females, males were more sensitive to stress. The scores on depression, negative affect and positive coping before the stress induction may be able to predict the arousal of the sympathetic nervous system across the stress situations.},

abstract={In general chemistry laboratories, students learn practical laboratory skills through hands-on activities and are exposed to new scientific instruments. However, these instruments are often viewed as black boxes for various reasons, where students do not know how to use them or what the instruments are capable of. This tendency is likely to induce some measure of fear in the students' attitude toward learning about instruments, even though instrumentation is a significant part of laboratory education. Augmented reality in educational laboratory (ARiEL) is an application utilizing AR technology designed to connect students to information on scientific instruments. ARiEL can be downloaded and used on phones or tablets while students are working on experiments, providing them with direct and immediate forms of information about laboratory instruments. Currently, the pH meter and conductivity meter are two instruments ARiEL can recognize as they are small, benchtop devices often used in general chemistry laboratory courses. An initial usability study with a focus group of first-term general chemistry students indicated that the application is not only easy to use but also preferred over a common search engine when looking for information on specific instruments. The application was used in a second-term general chemistry laboratory course and tested for usability evaluation and to measure students' attitude toward chemistry instrumentation. The results suggest that the availability of ARiEL helps to reduce anxiety associated with using instruments and to improve intellectual accessibility.},

abstract={Performance-based functional tests for the evaluation of daily living activities demonstrate strong psychometric properties and solve many of the limitations associated with self- and informant-report questionnaires. Virtual reality (VR) technology, which has gained interest as an effective medium for administering interventions in the context of healthcare, has the potential to minimize the time-demands associated with the administration and scoring of performance-based assessments. To date, efforts to develop VR systems for assessment of everyday function in older adults generally have relied on non-immersive systems. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of an immersive VR environment for the assessment of everyday function in older adults. We present a detailed case report of an elderly woman who performed an everyday activity in an immersive VR context (Virtual Reality Action Test) with two different types of interaction devices (controller vs. sensor). VR performance was compared to performance of the same task with real objects outside of the VR system (Real Action Test). Comparisons were made on several dimensions, including (1) quality of task performance (e.g., order of task steps, errors, use and speed of hand movements); (2) subjective impression (e.g., attitudes), and (3) physiological markers of stress. Subjective impressions of performance with the different controllers also were compared for presence, cybersickness, and usability. Results showed that the participant was capable of using controllers and sensors to manipulate objects in a purposeful and goal-directed manner in the immersive VR paradigm. She performed the everyday task similarly across all conditions. She reported no cybersickness and even indicated that interactions in the VR environment were pleasant and relaxing. Thus, immersive VR is a feasible approach for function assessment even with older adults who might have very limited computer experience, no prior VR exposure, average educational experiences, and mild cognitive difficulties. Because of inherent limitations of single case reports (e.g., unknown generalizability, potential practice effects, etc.), group studies are needed to establish the full psychometric properties of the Virtual Reality Action Test.},

abstract={The complete automation of software tests has been considered to be an unattainable goal. This article discusses the potential to achieve this goal with recent discoveries and innovations in the areas of virtual reality (VR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, a theoretical proposal is described to integrate the properties of each of these areas using a process of automation of software tests. This process is based on a classification and description of the properties after consulting the literature, interviews, and dialogs with specialists from Australia, the United States, Germany, and Colombia. In addition to the experiences of the researchers, the construction of two tools is proposed: (1) a robot to design and apply functional tests, and (2) a virtual machine to identify errors in the logical structure of the code. Both tools are expected to replace human factors; the advantage is that the first tool identifies procedural flaws and the second errors of operation.},

In this work, The Little Prince story written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is adapted to the ToM test questions to measure the SWND's ToM abilities. In this novel approach, three environments: a traditional 2D method (paper), the 2D display touch screen, and the AR visual display environments are experienced by the SWND. The experimental results are compared according to SWND's ToM success ratios, their ToM perspective skills', their satisfaction on these different test environments. This research suggests the novel approach to measure the ToM abilities of the SWND with human-computer interaction aspect.

abstract={There are major concerns about the suitability of immersive virtual reality (VR) systems (i.e., head-mounted display; HMD) to be implemented in research and clinical settings, because of the presence of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, and instability (i.e., VR induced symptoms and effects; VRISE). Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the presence and intensity of VRISE, but there are no suggestions regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The implementation of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and report both the quality of software features and VRISE intensity quantitatively. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire (VRNQ) was developed to assess the quality of VR software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty participants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study. They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions should be between 55 and 70 min when the VR software meets or exceeds the parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the VR system. Also, the gaming experience does not seem to affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially modulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion, better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity. The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs may appraise the suitability of VR software for implementation in research and clinical settings. The findings of this study contribute to the establishment of rigorous VR methods that are crucial for the viability of immersive VR as a research and clinical tool in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.},

abstract={Background: Prior laboratory findings indicate that training avoidance movements to angry faces may lower anger and aggression among healthy participants, especially those high in trait anger. To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, it has been developed into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). Methods: The proposed study will examine the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 60). In addition to the aggression replacement training, participants will play either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Anger will be assessed using self-report. Aggressive impulses will be measured via self-report, a validated laboratory paradigm, and rated by clinicians. Discussion: The authors hypothesize that the combination of the VR-GAIME and regular aggression treatment will be more successful in reducing aggressive behavior. One of the strengths of the proposed study is that it is the first to examine the effects of a motivational intervention in a clinical sample characterized by problems in regulating anger and aggression. Another strength of the proposed study is that the VR-GAIME will be implemented as a multi-session intervention. Additionally, the VR-GAIME applies, for the first time, serious gaming and virtual reality on an avoidance motivation intervention. If positive results are found, the VR-GAIME may be systematically deployed in forensic psychiatric settings. Trial registration: The trial is registered with The Netherlands National Trial Register, number: NTR6986.},

abstract={Objectives: Attention Restoration Theory (ART) suggests that walking or being in natural settings, as opposed to urban environments, benefits cognitive skills because it is less demanding on attentional resources. However, it is unclear whether the same occurs when the person is performing a complex task such as driving, although it is proven that driving through different road environments is associated with different levels of fatigue and may engage attention differently. The present study investigated whether exposure to rural vs. urban road environments while driving would affect attentional capacity in young people after the drive, in line with the classic ART paradigms. Methods: We asked 38 young participants to complete the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) before and after being exposed to a rural or urban road in a virtual reality environment while driving in a full vehicle immersive driving simulator. Changes in SART performance based on environmental exposure where explored in terms of target sensitivity, accuracy, reaction times, and inverse efficiency. We analyzed potential road type effects on driving speed and accuracy. Possible effects of driving on attention were tested by comparing the sample performance to that of a control group of 15 participants who did not drive and sat on the passenger seat instead. Results: Exposure to rural or urban road environments in the driving sample was not associated with any significant changes in attentional performance. The two exposure groups did not differ significantly in terms of driving behavior. Comparisons between the driving sample and the control group controlling for age indicated that participants who drove were more accurate but slower at the SART than those who were passengers. Conclusion: The present study does not support the hypothesis that a short drive in a natural setting may promote attention restoration as compared to an urban setting. Methodological considerations as well as recommendations for future research are discussed.},

abstract={Software testing is regarded as an important method for fault revealing. Despite this advantage, it has been poorly used within the scope of virtual reality (VR) applications because they are highly complex and have peculiar features. Most testing performed of this VR applications are usability, which is conducted manually and only at final of the development process. Although some works try to propose criteria for this domain, there are no approaches that automatize the generation of test data from requirements specification in the VR domain. This paper proposes an approach called virtual reality—requirements specification and testing (VR‐ReST) to assist the requirements specification through a semiformal language and uses structural test criteria to generate test requirements and test data automatically for VR applications using scene graph concepts. The paper also examines the empirical results concerning the cost‐effectiveness of the approach for three different VR applications through two experiments. Mutation testing was used to evaluate effectiveness. We found that the approach achieved a high mutation score outperforming random testing, by 20%, on average. Our results also demonstrate that the approach is promising since it assists in writing and validating the requirements, as well as in reducing the risks of requirement specification by adopting a semiformal language.},

abstract={This study was performed to examine the psychometric properties of a Virtual-Reality Prospective Memory Test (Hong Kong Chinese version; VRPMT-CV). The VRPMT was administered to 44 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia. The test was administered again 2 weeks later to establish test-retest reliability. The concurrent validity of the VRPMT was evaluated by examining the correlations between the VRPMT score and the score on the Chinese version of the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT-CV). The performance of individuals with schizophrenia on the VRPMT was also compared with that of 42 healthy control subjects to examine the test's sensitivity and specificity. The intraclass correlation for test-retest reliability of the total VRPMT-CV score was 0.78 (p = .005). A significant correlation was found between the total VRPMT-CV score and the total CAMPROMPT-CV score (r = 0.90; p < .001). Comparison with the healthy control subjects revealed that the total VRPMT-CV score was a sensitive (92.9%) and specific (75%) measure of prospective memory deficits in individuals with schizophrenia. The VRPMT-CV is an assessment of prospective memory that has good construct validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity and specificity in the context of first-episode schizophrenia.},

abstract={Eating is a multimodal experience. When we eat, we perceive not just the taste and aroma of foods, but also their visual, auditory, and tactile properties, as well as sensory input from our surroundings. Foods are commonly tested within a sensory booth, designed specifically to limit such input. Foods are not commonly experienced in such isolation, but alongside this context, which can alter how a food is perceived. In this study, we show that the sensory properties of food can be altered by changing the environment it is consumed in, using virtual reality (VR) to provide an immersive, dynamic context to the eating experience. The purpose of this project was to develop an affordable and easy‐to‐implement methodology for adapting VR technology to sensory evaluation, without prohibitive amounts of expensive equipment or specialized programming knowledge. Virtual environments were formed by processing custom‐recorded 360 degree videos and overlaying audio, text, sensory scales, and images to simulate a typical sensory evaluation ballot within the VR headset. In a pilot test, participants were asked to taste 3 identical blue cheese samples in 3 virtual contexts–a sensory booth, a park bench, and a cow barn. Respondents rated their liking of the sample, as well as its saltiness, and pungency, attributes either reflective of one context (pungency in the barn), or presumably unrelated (saltiness).

abstract={Eating is a multimodal experience. When we eat, we perceive not just the taste and aroma of foods, but also their visual, auditory, and tactile properties, as well as sensory input from our surroundings. Foods are commonly tested within a sensory booth, designed specifically to limit such input. Foods are not commonly experienced in such isolation, but alongside this context, which can alter how a food is perceived. In this study, we show that the sensory properties of food can be altered by changing the environment it is consumed in, using virtual reality (VR) to provide an immersive, dynamic context to the eating experience. The purpose of this project was to develop an affordable and easy‐to‐implement methodology for adapting VR technology to sensory evaluation, without prohibitive amounts of expensive equipment or specialized programming knowledge. Virtual environments were formed by processing custom‐recorded 360 degree videos and overlaying audio, text, sensory scales, and images to simulate a typical sensory evaluation ballot within the VR headset.

abstract={PurposeTo develop and validate a smartphone based Virtual Reality Epley Maneuver System (VREMS) for home use.MethodsA smartphone application was designed to produce stereoscopic views of a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, which when viewed after placing a smartphone in a virtual reality headset, allowed the user to be guided step-by-step through the Epley maneuver in a VR environment. Twenty healthy participants were recruited and randomized to undergo either assisted Epleys or self-administered Epleys following reading instructions from an Instructional Handout (IH). All participants were filmed and two expert Otologists reviewed the videos, assigning each participant a score (out of 10) for performance on each step. Participants rated their perceived workload by completing a validated task-load questionnaire (NASA Task Load Index) and averages for both groups were calculated.ResultsTwenty participants were evaluated with average age 26.4±7.12years old in the VREMS group and 26.1±7.72 in the IH group. The VR assisted group achieved an average score of 7.78±0.99 compared to 6.65±1.72 in the IH group. This result was statistically significant with p=0.0001 and side dominance did not appear to play a factor. Analyzing each step of the Epley maneuver demonstrated that assisted Epleys were done more accurately with statically significant results in steps 2–4. Results of the NASA-TLX scores were variable with no significant findings.ConclusionWe have developed and demonstrated face validity for VREMS through our randomized controlled trial. The VREMS platform is promising technology, which may improve the accuracy and effectiveness of home Epley treatments.Level of evidenceN/A.},

abstract={Multimodal interactivity when supported in a foot reflexology virtual reality environment has the potential to relieve stress. Current works leading to the development of such an environment have focused on creating models involving human to human (H-to-H) interactions which later could be used as design requirements. The goal is to translate these requirements and lay foundation for the future foot reflexology virtual reality stress therapy (VRST) application. Despite the intention, the development missed an important activity that is feedback from those experts in the domain. This paper closes the gap by presenting an expert review to the multimodal H-to-H interaction model as a form of validation. Eight experts from the human computer interaction (HCI) domain or related field reviewed and provided feedback on the model. The reviews were utilised to reconstruct the multimodal H-to-H interaction model, consequently yielding a final validated model for foot reflexology VRST application.},

abstract={Presence is one of the most important psychological constructs for understanding human-computer interaction. However, different terminology and operationalizations of presence across fields have plagued the comparability and generalizability of results across studies. Lee's (2004) unified understanding of presence as a multidimensional construct made up of physical, social, and self-presence, has created a unified theory of presence; nevertheless, there are still no psychometrically valid measurement instruments based on the theory. Two studies were conducted that describe the development of a standardized multidimensional measure of presence (the MPS) for a VR learning context based on this theory, and its validation using confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory. The results from Study 1 which included 161 medical students from Denmark indicated that the items used in the MPS measure a three dimensional theoretical model of presence: physical, social, and self-presence. Furthermore, IRT analyses indicated that it was possible to limit the number of items in the MPS to 15 (five items per sub-dimension) while maintaining the construct validity and reliability of the measure. The results of Study 2, which included 118 biology students from Scotland, supported the validity and generalizability of the MPS in a new context.},

abstract={Background Persecutory delusions may be unfounded threat beliefs maintained by safety-seeking behaviours that prevent disconfirmatory evidence being successfully processed. Use of virtual reality could facilitate new learning. Aims To test the hypothesis that enabling patients to test the threat predictions of persecutory delusions in virtual reality social environments with the dropping of safety-seeking behaviours (virtual reality cognitive therapy) would lead to greater delusion reduction than exposure alone (virtual reality exposure). Method Conviction in delusions and distress in a real-world situation were assessed in 30 patients with persecutory delusions. Patients were then randomised to virtual reality cognitive therapy or virtual reality exposure, both with 30 min in graded virtual reality social environments. Delusion conviction and real-world distress were then reassessed. Results In comparison with exposure, virtual reality cognitive therapy led to large reductions in delusional conviction (reduction 22.0%, P= 0.024, Cohen's d= 1.3) and real-world distress (reduction 19.6%, P= 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.8).

abstract={Virtual reality adaptations of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR) constitute useful tools for studying the physiologic axes involved in the stress response. Here, we aimed to determine the most appropriate experimental approach to the TSST-VR when investigating the modulation of the axes involved in the stress response. We compared the use of goggles versus a screen projection in the TSST-VR paradigm. Forty-five healthy participants were divided into two groups: the first one (goggles condition; 13 females, 11 males) wore goggles while performing the TSST-VR; the second (screen condition; 15 females, six males) was exposed to the TSST-VR projected on a screen. Sympathetic reactivity to stress was measured by continuously recording skin conductance (SC), while the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) was evaluated by sampling salivary cortisol throughout the experiment. At the end of the task, there was an increase in SC and cortisol level for both means of delivering the TSST-VR, although the increase in SC was greater in the goggles condition, while salivary cortisol was comparable in both groups. Immersion levels were reportedly higher in the screen presentation than in the goggles group. In terms of sex differences, females experienced greater involvement and spatial presence, though comparatively less experienced realism, than their male counterparts. These findings help us determine which protocol of the TSST-VR is most suitable for the stress response under study. They also emphasize the need to consider the sex of participants, as males and females show distinct responses in each protocol.},

abstract={Background Virtual reality (VR) simulators provide an alternative to real patients for practicing surgical skills but require validation to ensure accuracy. Here, we validate the use of a virtual reality sinus surgery simulator with haptic feedback for training in Otorhinolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery (OHNS). Methods Participants were recruited from final-year medical students, interns, resident medical officers (RMOs), OHNS registrars and consultants. All participants completed an online questionnaire after performing four separate simulation tasks. These were then used to assess face, content and construct validity. anova with post hoc correlation was used for statistical analysis. Results The following groups were compared: (i) medical students/interns, (ii) RMOs, (iii) registrars and (iv) consultants. Face validity results had a statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference between the consultant group and others, while there was no significant difference between medical student/intern and RMOs. Variability within groups was not significant. Content validity results based on consultant scoring and comments indicated that the simulations need further development in several areas to be effective for registrar-level teaching. However, students, interns and RMOs indicated that the simulations provide a useful tool for learning OHNS-related anatomy and as an introduction to ENT-specific procedures. Conclusions The VR simulations have been validated for teaching sinus anatomy and nasendoscopy to medical students, interns and RMOs. However, they require further development before they can be regarded as a valid tool for more advanced surgical training.},

abstract={Usability testing is expensive in some domains due to the resource requirements that go hand in hand with taking a complex context of use into account. Crisis-related research is one such domain, typically requiring the reenactment of an extensive crisis scenario. To lessen the resource requirements and provide a more flexible setup geared towards testing, crisis scenarios can be reconstructed as virtual reality simulations. This paper outlines the development of an initial prototype of such a simulation following the design science method. The prototype is used to test if injecting an item that will be tested into the simulation affects the realism of the virtual reality crisis simulation. The realism was measured in a within-subject experiment and equivalence tests showed that injecting a representation of a simple app had no significant influence on the realism of the simulation.},

abstract={Designing a usable learning application is one of the key factors in ensuring effective learning. This article introduces modified group usability testing (MGUT) as a feasible framework for evaluating the usability of non-immersive virtual reality (VR) learning applications. Conventionally, usability testing of such learning applications often employs the one-to-one approach in which an evaluator conducts testing with several individual participants. As opposed to the one-to-one approach, the group approach involves several-to-many participants performing tasks simultaneously, with several evaluators observing and interacting with participants. This article describes the complete step-by-step procedure for conducting MGUT to uncover usability problems of a VR learning application that aims to educate its users on fire safety and prevention. It also proposes methods to analyze these usability problems. The effectiveness and efficiency of MGUT was then compared with DGUT, the original group testing technique and cooperative evaluation (CE), which is a typical one-to-one approach. Results indicate that all three techniques are able to reveal usability problems of different usability factors and show similar capability to discover the most critical and serious problems. MGUT is more effective than DGUT as it can collect additional usability problems of various factors and of different levels of severity. MGUT is as effective as CE as both techniques can identify usability problems which are more or less comparable in terms of quantity and quality. As for efficiency, MGUT and DGUT are more efficient than CE as these group testing approaches require lesser testing time, lesser effort in terms of the intensive interaction with participants although with slight more effort in the preparation of the physical setting. In addition, it is also obvious that MGUT and DGUT involve richer participation than CE. MGUT is also more feasible than DGUT as it allows some flexibility in the computer arrangement setting.},

abstract={Ease of entry and exit is important for creating a positive first impression of a car and increasing customer satisfaction. Several methods are used within vehicle development to optimise ease of entry and exit, including CAD reviews, benchmarking and buck trials. However, there is an industry trend towards digital methods to reduce the costs and time associated with developing physical prototypes. This paper reports on a study of entry strategy in three properties (buck, car, CAVE) in which inconsistencies were demonstrated by people entering a vehicle representation in the CAVE. In a second study industry practitioners rated the CAVE as worse than physical methods for identifying entry and exit issues, and having lower perceived validity and reliability. However, the resource issues associated with building bucks were recognised. Recommendations are made for developing the CAVE and for combinations of methods for use at different stages of a vehicle's development.},

abstract={Purpose To design and validate a desktop virtual reality (VR) system, for presentation and assessment of volumetric data, based on commercially off-the-shelf hardware as an alternative to a fully immersive CAVE-like I-Space VR system. Methods We designed a desktop VR system, using a three-dimensional (3D) monitor and a six degrees-of-freedom tracking system. A personal computer uses the V-Scope (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) volume-rendering application, developed for the I-Space, to create a hologram of volumetric data. Inter- and intraobserver reliability for crown-rump length and embryonic volume measurements are investigated using Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. Time required for the measurements was recorded. Results Comparing the I-Space and the desktop VR system, the mean difference for crown-rump length is -0.34% (limits of agreement -2.58-1.89, ±2.24%) and for embryonic volume -0.92% (limits of agreement -6.97-5.13, ±6.05%). Intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients of the desktop VR system were all >0.99. Measurement times were longer on the desktop VR system compared with the I-Space, but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions A user-friendly desktop VR system can be put together using commercially off-the-shelf hardware at an acceptable price. This system provides a valid and reliable method for embryonic length and volume measurements and can be used in clinical practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={The use of virtual reality for the provision of motor-cognitive gait training has been shown to be effective for a variety of patient populations. The interaction between the user and the virtual environment is achieved by tracking the motion of the body parts and replicating it in the virtual environment in real time. In this paper, we present the validation of a novel method for tracking foot position and orientation in real time, based on the Microsoft Kinect technology, to be used for gait training combined with virtual reality. The validation of the motion tracking method was performed by comparing the tracking performance of the new system against a stereo-photogrammetric system used as gold standard. Foot position errors were in the order of a few millimeters (average RMSD from 4.9 to 12.1 mm in the medio-lateral and vertical directions, from 19.4 to 26.5 mm in the anterior-posterior direction); the foot orientation errors were also small (average syntax error at token \\ from 5.6% to 8.8% in the medio-lateral and vertical directions, from 15.5% to 18.6% in the anterior-posterior direction). The results suggest that the proposed method can be effectively used to track feet motion in virtual reality and treadmill-based gait training programs.},

abstract={The difficulty of isolating intact, mineralogically pure pedogenic crystals from cemented soil is one of the most significant obstacles to quantifying rates of soil formation, geomorphic processes, and climate change in arid regions. We evaluate the applicability of vacuum encapsulated super(40)Ar/ super(39)Ar geochronology to pedogenic palygorskite and sepiolite extracted from the 4 to 5 Ma, extant Mormon Mesa petrocalcic soil-geomorphic surface of southern Nevada, and from the 780 ka to 2 Ma Jornada Experimental Range La Mesa soil-geomorphic surface near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Selective dissolution of cements using NaOAc and Tiron, accompanied by particle size fractionation, was used to isolate the pedogenic Mg-phyllosilicates. Scanning electron microscopy, inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, gas chromatograph mass spectrometry, and Ar isotope analysis were used to determine whether extraction impacted palygorskite/sepiolite suitability for super(40)Ar/ super(39)Ar geochronology. We found no adverse morphological or mineralogical effects, but meaningful ages could not be obtained due to small amounts of old, detrital phyllosilicates in the samples. While the potential of pedogenic palygorskite and/or sepiolite for geochronology now seems limited, results from this study may prove relevant for samples from other, non-pedogenic surface environments. It is hoped that this work will encourage further research towards successful super(40)Ar/ super(39)Ar geochronology of pedogenic phyllosilicates, as well as inform future geochemical or isotopic studies of individual pedogenic mineral species.},

abstract={Previous investigations conducted on post-secondary adult students with learning disabilities (LD) suggest that deficits in visual-motor skills contribute to difficulties in written expression which impact academic achievement. Intervention strategies for individuals with LD include assistive computer-based technologies (ATs) to compensate for or maximize performance. However, research fails to assess the impact of ATs on performance, learning, and motivation of students with LD. Also, one of the limitations of ATs is that they cannot be used for assessment and training and there are very few methods to assess or train visual-motor skills in this population. The present study explores the usefulness of a hapto-visual virtual reality motor skills assessment (MSA) device for visual-motor functioning in adults with and without LD. This is a preliminary step of developing an intervention to improve impaired visual-motor skills in adults with LD. A sample of 22 male and female university students with and without LD had their visual-motor skills pretested using a standard paper-and-pencil Bender-Gestalt (BG) test and were compared according to their performance on the MSA tool. We hypothesized that our LD participants' performance would be significantly lower than our control participants on the VR task in terms of number of errors and speed. Results showed that participants without LD performed better and more rapidly on the VR task than participants with LD. There were no correlations between the BG and MSA performance. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the Bender-Gestalt scores, previous experience with video game, arousal, and mood. Our results suggest that a novel 3D virtual reality tool such as the MSA can potentially discriminate motor function of people with and without LD; however, the difference between both may also be due to a lack of problem-solving ability in LD.},

abstract={Background: In many telemedicine applications, the correct use of medical device at the point of need is essential to provide an appropriate service. Some applications may require untrained people to interact with medical devices and patients: care delivery in transportation, military actions, home care and telemedicine training. Appropriate operation of medical device and correct connection with patient's body are crucial. In these scenarios, tailored applications of Augmented Reality can offer a valid support by guiding untrained people at the point of need. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using Augmented Reality in telemedicine applications, by facilitating an acceptable use of biomedical equipment by any unskilled person. In particular, a prototype system was built in order to estimate how untrained users, with limited or no knowledge, can effectively interact with an ECG device and properly placing ECG electrodes on patient's chest. Methods: An Augmented Reality application was built to support untrained users in performing an ECG test. Simple markers attached to the ECG device and onto patient's thorax allow camera calibration. Once objects and their pose in the space are recognized, the video of the current scene is enriched, in real-time, with additional pointers, text boxes and audio that help the untrained operator to perform the appropriate sequence of operations. All the buttons, switches, ports of the ECG device together with the location of precordial leads were coded and indicated. Some user's voice commands were also included to improve usability. Results: Ten untrained volunteers, supported by the augmented reality, were able to carry out a complete ECG test first on a mannequin and then on a real patient in a reasonable time (about 8 minutes on average). Average positioning errors of precordial electrodes resulted less than 3 mm for the mannequin and less than 7 mm for the real patient. These preliminary findings suggest the effectiveness of the developed application and the validity of clinical ECG recordings. Conclusion: This application can be adapted to support the use of other medical equipment as well as other telemedicine tasks and it could be performed with a Tablet or a Smartphone.},

abstract={Background: Virtual reality (VR) is not commonly used in clinical rehabilitation, and commercial VR gaming systems may have mixed effects in patients with stroke. Therefore, we developed RehabMaster(TM), a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy. Methods: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects, and drop-out rate were recorded. Results: The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (P = .03) and MBI (P = .04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement in the FMA (P = .07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI. One patient with chronic stroke left the trial, and no adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: The RehabMaster is a feasible and safe VR system for enhancing upper extremity function in patients with stroke.},

abstract={Neurophysiological data indicate that the reachable peripersonal space and the unreachable extrapersonal space are represented in segregated parietofrontal circuits and that when the unreachable space becomes reachable because of tool use, it is automatically coded by the network selective for peripersonal space. Here we directly tested the role of action's consequences in space coding. Thirty-eight participants bisected lines at either a reachable distance (60 cm) or unreachable distance (120 cm) using either a laser pointer or laser cutter. The laser cutter but not the laser pointer had an action consequence; the line broke into two pieces. The results showed that distance moderated the effect of action. At an unreachable distance, the mean bisection point was closer to the centre when participants used the laser cutter compared to when they used the laser pointer. There were no differences at a reachable distance (60 cm). This result suggests that the space in which the individual may determine a physical consequence is categorized as peripersonal space, independently from its actual distance from the individual's body.},

abstract={Virtual reality dental training simulators, unlike traditional human-based assessment, have the potential to enable consistent and reliable assessment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a haptic simulator (IDEA Dental) could provide a reliable and valid assessment of manual dexterity. A total of 106 participants were divided into three groups differing in dental manual dexterity experience: (i) 63 dental students, (ii) 28 dentists, (iii) 14 non-dentists. The groups, which were expected to display various performance levels, were required to perform virtual drilling tasks in different geometric shapes. The following task parameters were registered: (i) Time to completion (ii) accuracy (iii) number of trials to successful completion and (iv) score provided by the simulator. The reliability of the tasks was calculated for each parameter. The simulator and its scoring algorithm showed high reliability in all the parameters measured. The simulator was able to differentiate between non-professionals and dental students or non-professionals and dentists. Our study suggests that for improved construct validity, shorter working times and more difficult tasks should be introduced. The device should also be designed to provide greater sensitivity in measuring the accuracy of the task. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This work presents the protocol carried out in the development and validation of an augmented reality system which was installed in an operating theatre to help surgeons with trocar placement during laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of this validation is to demonstrate the improvements that this system can provide to the field of medicine, particularly surgery. Method . Two experiments that were noninvasive for both the patient and the surgeon were designed. In one of these experiments the augmented reality system was used, the other one was the control experiment, and the system was not used. The type of operation selected for all cases was a cholecystectomy due to the low degree of complexity and complications before, during, and after the surgery. The technique used in the placement of trocars was the French technique, but the results can be extrapolated to any other technique and operation. Results and Conclusion . Four clinicians and ninety-six measurements obtained of twenty-four patients (randomly assigned in each experiment) were involved in these experiments. The final results show an improvement in accuracy and variability of 33% and 63%, respectively, in comparison to traditional methods, demonstrating that the use of an augmented reality system offers advantages for trocar placement in laparoscopic surgery.},

abstract={The purpose of this research was to evaluate an operation system that includes a control method of feedback previously proposed by our lab, in a virtual reality setting. Specifically, we examined a master-slave control system for a teleoperation construction robot. The master comprises two joysticks adopted to manipulate objects from a remote location, and the slave corresponds to an excavator with four degrees of freedom, regarded as a construction robot. The authors previously proposed a control method to provide an operator with a realistic sensation of grasping by introducing a noticeable reaction torque to the joystick's handling and a variable master torque gain according to an object's hardness when the robot moves slowly to grasp a soft object. In this research, an operability test was conducted when the control method was introduced to actual tasks, including grasping, conveying and classifying tasks using concrete blocks and sponge foam blocks. Measurement of mental strain using NASA-TLX and measurement of physiology strain using heart rate variability were recommended as evaluation methods in addition to the use of task efficiency and danger indexes. According to statistical analysis of the experimental results, we verified that the control method used in the operation system could contribute to improving efficiency and safety during teleoperation work as well as alleviating the operator's mental fatigue and stress.},

abstract={The design of a new product requires a series of validations before its approval and manufacture. Virtual prototyping based on mixed reality technology seems a promising technique, especially when applied to the design review of products that are characterised by interaction with users. This paper presents a new methodology that allows the collaborative design review and modification of some components of automotive interiors. Professionals can work together through a mixed reality distributed design platform by interacting intuitively and naturally with the virtual prototype of the product. The methodology has been validated by means of tests with users, aiming at assessing the effectiveness of the approach, and at identifying potential usability issues.},

abstract={One of the most common methods of inducing stress in the laboratory in order to examine the stress response in healthy and clinical populations is the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Briefly, the participant is asked to deliver a speech and to perform an arithmetic task in front of an evaluating committee. The committee, consisting of three trained actors, does not respond emotionally during the test, which makes the situation very stressful for the participant. One disadvantage of the TSST is that it can be difficult to hold the experimental conditions constant. In particular, it may be difficult for actors to hold their acting constant across all sessions. Furthermore, there are several practical problems and costs associated with hiring professional actors. A computerized version of the TSST using virtual humans could be a way to avoid these problems provided that it is able to induce a stress response similar to the one of the original TSST. The purpose of the present pilot study was therefore to investigate the stress response to a virtual reality (VR) version of the TSST visualized using an immersive VR system (VR-TSST). Seven healthy males with an average age of 24 years (range: 23-26 years) performed the VR-TSST. This included delivering a speech and performing an arithmetic task in front of an evaluating committee consisting of three virtual humans. The VR equipment was a CAVE equipped with stereoscopy and head tracking. ECG and respiration were recorded as well as the participant's behavior and comments. Afterward, a semi-structured interview was carried out. In general, the subjective and physiological data from the experiment indicated that the VR version of the TSST induced a stress response in the seven participants. In particular, the peak increase in heart rate was close to rates observed in studies using the traditional TSST with real actors. These results suggest that virtual humans visualized with an immersive VR system can be used to induce stress under laboratory conditions.},

Background- There is a need for improved screening methods for spatial neglect. Aim- To construct a VR-test battery and evaluate its accuracy and usability in patients with acute stroke. Method- VR-DiSTRO consists of a standard desktop computer, a CRT monitor and eye shutter stereoscopic glasses, a force feedback interface, and software, developed to create an interactive and immersive 3D experience. VR-tests were developed and validated to the conventional Star Cancellation test, Line bisection, Baking Tray Task (BTT), and Visual Extinction test. A construct validation to The Rivermead Behavioral Inattention Test, used as criterion of visuospatial neglect, was made. Usability was assessed according to ISO 9241-11. Results- Thirty-one patients with stroke were included, 9/31 patients had neglect. The sensitivity was 100% and the specificity 82% for the VR-DiSTRO to correctly identify neglect. VR-BTT and VR-Extinction had the highest correlation (r2=0.64 and 0.78), as well as high sensitivity and specificity. The kappa values describing the agreement between traditional neglect tests and the corresponding virtual reality test were between 0.47-0.85. Usability was assessed by a questionnaire; 77% reported that the VR-DiSTRO was 'easy' to use. Eighty-eight percent reported that they felt 'focused', 'pleased' or 'alert'. No patient had adverse symptoms. The test session took 15min. Conclusions- The VR-DiSTRO quickly and with a high accuracy identified visuospatial neglect in patients with stroke in this construct validation. The usability among elderly patients with stroke was high. This VR-test battery has the potential to become an important screening instrument for neglect and a valuable adjunct to the neuropsychological assessment.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of the Virtual Reality (VR) version of the Multiple Errands Test (MET) (Shallice & Burgess, 1991; Fortin et al., 2003) based on the NeuroVR software as an assessment tool for executive functions. In particular, the MET is an assessment of executive functions in daily life, which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where items need to be bought and information needs to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 5), healthy, young participants (n = 5), and healthy, older participants (n = 5). Specific objectives were (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and at the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy, young controls and older controls in the VMET and at the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions.},

abstract={The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a widely used protocol to induce stress in laboratory settings. Briefly, in the TSST, the test participant is asked to hold a speech and to do an arithmetic task in front of an audience. In the present pilot study, we examined endocrine and autonomic reactivity and habituation to repeated stress provocations using a virtual reality (VR) version of TSST. The VR system was a CAVETM] system with three rear projected walls (4 mx 3 m), and one floor projection. The system also included a head tracking system and passive stereoscopy. The virtual audience consisted of one woman, and two men. ten healthy men, mean age 28.3 years (24-38 years), were confronted with the test twice (1 week between sessions), during which salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV, parasympathetic activity), and T-wave amplitude (TWA, suggested to be related to sympathetic influence on myocardial performance) were assessed. Cortisol secretion showed a marked increase (88% vs. baseline) during the first stress provocation, but habituated in the second session. The magnitude of HR and TWA reactivity during stress provocation was approximately the same at both sessions, implying a stable increase in sympathetic activity. Heart rate showed a maximum increase of 40% at the first session, and 32% at the second. TWA showed a maximum decrease of 42% at the first session, and 39% at the second. The results resemble those obtained in prior studies using the real-life TSST. If these results can be replicated with larger samples, VR technology may be used as a simple and standardized tool for social stress induction in experimental settings.},

abstract={Stroke is a frequent cause of adult disability that can lead to enduring impairments. However, given the life-long plasticity of the brain one could assume that recovery could be facilitated by the harnessing of mechanisms underlying neuronal reorganization. Currently it is not clear how this reorganization can be mobilized. Novel technology based neurorehabilitation techniques hold promise to address this issue. Here we describe a Virtual Reality (VR) based system, the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) that is based on a number of hypotheses on the neuronal mechanisms underlying recovery, the structure of training and the role of individualization. We investigate the psychometrics of the RGS in stroke patients and healthy controls. We describe the key components of the RGS and the psychometrics of one rehabilitation scenario called Spheroids. We performed trials with 21 acute/subacute stroke patients and 20 healthy controls to study the effect of the training parameters on task performance. This allowed us to develop a Personalized Training Module (PTM) for online adjustment of task difficulty. In addition, we studied task transfer between physical and virtual environments. Finally, we assessed the usability and acceptance of the RGS as a rehabilitation tool. We show that the PTM implemented in RGS allows us to effectively adjust the difficulty and the parameters of the task to the user by capturing specific features of the movements of the arms. The results reported here also show a consistent transfer of movement kinematics between physical and virtual tasks. Moreover, our usability assessment shows that the RGS is highly accepted by stroke patients as a rehabilitation tool. We introduce a novel VR based paradigm for neurorehabilitation, RGS, which combines specific rehabilitative principles with a psychometric evaluation to provide a personalized and automated training. Our results show that the RGS effectively adjusts to the individual features of the user, allowing for an unsupervised deployment of individualized rehabilitation protocols.},

abstract={System evaluation and testing of unmanned underwater vehicles in their destined environment can be tedious, error prone, time consuming, and consequently expensive. However, pre-real-world testing facilities, such as hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, are not always available. This is due to the time and expense required to create a specific test environment for the vehicle. Thus the system is not as fault tolerant as it could be since problems can remain undetected until the real-world testing phase. Debugging and fixing errors in the real-world testing phase are much more time consuming and expensive owing to the nature of the harsh underwater environment. This paper introduces a novel framework, the augmented-reality framework (ARF), for the rapid construction of virtual-environment testing scenarios for testing remote platforms with embedded systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles. The ARF provides testing facilities across all stages of the reality continuum, providing capabilities for pure simulation, HIL, hybrid simulation, and real-world testing. The framework architecture is both very generic and flexible and allows mixing of real and simulated components. The ARF is supported by a distributed communications protocol which provides location transparency of systems since this is key to providing mixed-reality testing facilities.},

abstract={Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space CenterE14s E-3 test facility.},

abstract={In recent years, virtual reality has emerged as an innovative tool for health-related education and training. Among the many benefits of virtual reality is the opportunity for novice users to engage unsupervised in a safe environment when the real environment might be dangerous. Virtual environments are only useful for health-related research, however, if behavior in the virtual world validly matches behavior in the real world. This study was designed to test the validity of an immersive, interactive virtual pedestrian environment. A sample of 102 children and 74 adults was recruited to complete simulated road-crossings in both the virtual environment and the identical real environment. In both the child and adult samples, construct validity was demonstrated via significant correlations between behavior in the virtual and real worlds. Results also indicate construct validity through developmental differences in behavior; convergent validity by showing correlations between parent-reported child temperament and behavior in the virtual world; internal reliability of various measures of pedestrian safety in the virtual world; and face validity, as measured by users'self-reported perception of realism in the virtual world. We discuss issues of generalizability to other virtual environments, and the implications for application of virtual reality to understanding and preventing pediatric pedestrian injuries.},

abstract={While standard neuropsychological measures have been found to have adequate predictive value, their ecological validity may diminish predictions about real world functioning. Virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly recognized as ecologically valid tools for neuropsychological assessment. We aim to develop a VE-based neuropsychological battery delivered within the context of a virtual city: Virtual Reality Cognitive Performance Assessment Test (VRCPAT). The 15 minute VRCPAT battery and 1.5 hour in-person neuropsychological assessment were conducted with a sample of 40 healthy adults, between the ages of 21 and 36, that included equivalent distributions of men and women from ethnically diverse populations. No subjects had history of psychiatric or neurologic conditions. Results supported both convergent and discriminant validity. The VRCPAT was found to correlate significantly with traditional neuropsychological tests assessing similar target constructs. No significant correlations existed between VRCPAT measures and non-target constructs. Findings suggest that the VRCPAT measures a capacity consistent with that of traditional neurocognitive measures; and is inconsistent with potential confounds. We conclude that the VRCPAT provides a unique opportunity to reliably and efficiently study neurocognitive function within an ecologically valid environment.},

Twenty-one students agreed to take part, 11 with high test anxiety and 10 with low test anxiety. The virtual environments were prepared in chronological order: the student's home, then the metro, and finally the corridor and lecture hall where the examination takes place. The results showed that the high-test-anxiety group presented higher levels of anxiety and depression than the low-test-anxiety group during exposure to the virtual environments. This study shows that virtual reality is able to provoke emotional responses in students with high test anxiety. This validation study should be followed up with treatment studies to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality therapy for treating test anxiety.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to highlight a validation action of virtual reality simulation to integrating health and safety right from design stage. We demonstrate first how simulations using virtual reality techniques help to narrow the area of uncertainty between two viewpoints: that of the work equipment ''designer'', who focuses on production constraints with respect to a prescribed task, and that of the end-user, who has to satisfy production constraints in relation to the resources at his disposal (personal, technical and organisational). We then introduce the method retained for validating these simulations. This focuses on the possibility of reproducing a reference activity through simulation. We distinguish two types of simulation validity: internal validity, which is based on the simulator's capacity to reproduce a task (a succession of simple operations), and external validity, which refers to the possibility of simulating activities comparable to those observed in real situations. The results presented concern mainly internal validity.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to develop a virtual cycling system and examine the influence of virtual reality (VR) or test performance during clinical exercise testing. We aimec to compare the physiological responses of the cardiovascular and ventilatory systems during incremental exercise testing with or without VR, and to measure VR effects on the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and cycling duration throughout the test. Twelve healthy senior citizens (ten men and two women) with a mean age of 74.5 plus/minus 4.7 years participated in the study. The codes of behavior for this study included a maximum graded exercise tolerance test, a submaximal endurance VR exercise, and a submaximal endurance non-VR exercise. A friction-braked cycle ergometer was used to conduct the exercise tests. For the subject's movement speed to create an appropriate environment flow on the display screen, the bike was connected to a personal computer. The cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated at both peak and submaximal exertion. The results show that the VR versus non-VR programs did not differ on submaximal and peak exercise responses during the cycling test. However, significant differences were observed between the mean values for cycling duration, distance, and energy consumption. The difference between RPE curves for VR and non-VR protocols revealed promising results within 45 min. of cycling (Breslow test, p = .06); however, no statistical significance was achieved at the test termination (log rank test, p = .17). In conclusion, this study, found that the maintenance of endurance, the increase in target intensity, and total energy consumption in exercise programs may be assisted by introducing VR technology. In addition, the activities taking place in virtual environments can be performed in complete safety.},
