abstract={The glutamate and γ‐aminobutyric acid neuroreceptor subtypes mGluR5 and GABAA are hypothesized to be involved in the development of a variety of psychiatric diseases. However, detailed information relating to their in vivo distribution is generally unavailable. Maps of such distributions could potentially aid clinical studies by providing a reference for the normal distribution of neuroreceptors and may also be useful as covariates in advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (MR) studies. In this study, we propose a comprehensive processing pipeline for the construction of standard space, in vivo distributions of non‐displaceable binding potential (BPND), and total distribution volume (VT) based on simultaneously acquired bolus‐infusion positron emission tomography (PET) and MR data. The pipeline was applied to 11C]ABP688‐PET/MR (13 healthy male non‐smokers, 26.6 ± 7.0 years) and 11C]Flumazenil‐PET/MR (10 healthy males, 25.8 ± 3.0 years) data. Activity concentration templates, as well as VT and BPND atlases of mGluR5 and GABAA, were generated from these data. The maps were validated by assessing the percent error δ from warped space to native space in a selection of brain regions. We verified that the average δABP = 3.0 ± 1.0% and δFMZ = 3.8 ± 1.4% were lower than the expected variabilities σ of the tracers (σABP = 4.0%–16.0%, σFMZ = 3.9%–9.5%). An evaluation of PET‐to‐PET registrations based on the new maps showed higher registration accuracy compared to registrations based on the commonly used 15O]H2O‐template distributed with SPM12. Thus, we conclude that the resulting maps can be used for further research and the proposed pipeline is a viable tool for the construction of standardized PET data distributions.},

abstract={AimThis study aimed to examine the dimensionality of the BCFQOL-AR using Rasch analysis.MethodThe sample consisted of 320 families having a member with intellectual or developmental disabilities. Rasch analysis was used to validate the dimensionality of the scale. The participants were from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.ResultsThe BCFQOL-AR 25-item scale was multidimensional. Rasch analyses support the unidimensionality of the five subscales. There were no indicators of differential item function for any of the items, regardless of sex or age.ConclusionThe BCFQOL-AR is a multidimensional scale that measures families with members who are satisfied with their quality of life. Therefore, obtaining a total score at the subscale level is supported and showed that each of the five subscales of the BCFQOL can be used alone. This study partially supports the practices used with other versions of the scale, by providing the statistical base, where means were used at the subscale level in different countries.},

abstract={The Chinese medicine Qigesan can be used to treat esophageal adenocarcinoma in the Chinese mainland widely, but its mechanism is unclear. In order to investigate the mechanism of Qigesan in the treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma, the concept of network pharmacology was used in this study. The database named TCMSP was used to identify the active therapeutic components as well as targets of Qigesan. The TTD, OMIM, CTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards database were used to identify genes related to esophageal adenocarcinoma. In STRING database, the potential targets were imported to obtain a PPI network, and then Cytoscape software has been used to analyse the results. Subsequently, important components and targets were simulated by molecular docking. Finally, experiments on the cell have been done to verify well docking targets. A total of 124 effective compounds and 646 corresponding targets were filtered. 1478 genes were found to be related to esophageal adenocarcinoma. 68 genes were identified as potential targets for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the 68 potential targets indicated that the genes were mainly involved in cell transcription, translation, and apoptosis and mostly expressed in cancer-related pathways. The molecular docking analysis of the hub targets with their corresponding compounds indicated that the well docking targets were AR, ERBB2, and VEGFA. The cell experiments showed that Qigesan can reduce the expression of AR, ERBB2, and VEGFA at transcription and translation level. This network pharmacology study described that the possible targets of Qigesan in treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma were AR, ERBB2, and VEGFA.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDDevelopment and validation of Veterans RAND 12-item (VR-12) physical component survey (PCS) has been established among civilian and veteran populations but it has not been examined among anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) patients.PURPOSES/QUESTIONSWe sought to validate legacy patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) with VR-12 PCS among patients undergoing ACDF procedures.METHODSA prospectively collected surgical registry was retrospectively evaluated for elective single or multi-level ACDFs performed for degenerative spinal pathologies from January 2014 to August 2019. Exclusion criteria included missing pre-operative surveys and surgery for trauma, metastasis, or infection. Demographic variables, baseline pathologies, and peri-operative variables were collected. A paired t test evaluated the change from the pre-operative score to each post-operative timepoint for VR-12 PCS, the 12-item Short-Form Survey (SF-12) PCS, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function (PROMIS-PF), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) achievement was calculated at each timepoint. Correlation was evaluated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient and time-independent partial correlation.RESULTSOf the 202 patients who underwent ACDF, 41.1% were female and the average age was 49.5 years. All PROMs had statistically significantly increased from baseline when compared with post-operative timepoints (12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years). MCID achievement rates increased through 2 years. All timepoints revealed strong VR-12 PCS correlations with SF-12 PCS, PROMIS-PF, and NDI scores.CONCLUSIONVR-12 PCS was strongly correlated with the well-validated SF-12 PCS and NDI metrics as well as with the more recent PROMIS-PF. All PROMs demonstrated statistically significant improvement in patients post-operatively. VR-12 PCS is a valid measure of physical function among patients undergoing ACDF.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study is to determine the potential role of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging in diagnosing brain death.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe study population was composed of 61 subjects (the Glasgow Coma Scale GCS] score was 3 for all subjects), and 26 subjects were assigned to the control group (GCS scores between 4 and 6). At least four regions of interest (ROIs) from different anatomical regions were measured, the mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and signal intensity time-to-course graphic were calculated. A second neurological examination (including an apnea test) was accepted as the gold standard method for the diagnosis of brain death.RESULTSDSC-MR perfusion imaging diagnosed brain death with a specificity of 100% (61/61) and a sensitivity of 86.8% (53/61). A cut-off value of maximum 3.5% decrease in the signal intensity time-to-course graphic was calculated by the Youden's index and established for the to differentiate brain death from other conditions.CONCLUSIONDSC-MR perfusion imaging is a promising tool that may be used as a reliable add-on confirmatory diagnostic test for the brain death.},

abstract={Bilateral normal testes asymmetry represents an interesting phenomenon. The aim was to assess possible differences in the biochemical profile of bilateral normal testes by 3.0 T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H‐MRS). Twenty‐one men were examined with scrotal 3.0 T MRI, including a single‐voxel point‐resolved spectroscopy sequence. MR spectra were obtained by placing a volume of interest in the middle of each normal testis. Normalised metabolite concentrations, defined as ratios of the calculated metabolite concentrations relative to creatine (Cr) concentration, were compared between bilateral normal testes using Mann–Whitney U test. 1H‐MRS allowed the detection of certain testicular metabolites, including total choline, Cr, myo‐inositol, Glx, total lipids and macromolecules resonating at 0.9, 1.3 and 2.0 ppm. Normal left testis had higher median normalised concentrations of Glx (p = .002) and lactate (p = .041) compared with the normal right testis. Differences in concentrations of Glx were attributed to differences in glutamate (p = .020). Normal testes asymmetry is confirmed in this study by differences in the biochemical testicular profile, as assessed by 3.0 T 1H‐MRS. Increase in levels of glutamate and lactate in normal left testis should be correlated with changes in metabolic pathways, specifically glycometabolism and amino acid metabolism.},

abstract={BackgroundQuantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and dynamic contrast‐enhanced quantitative permeability (DCEQP) on magnetic resonance (MR) have been shown to correlate with neurovascular disease progression as markers of vascular leakage and hemosiderin deposition. Applying these techniques as monitoring biomarkers in clinical trials will be necessary; however, their validation across multiple MR platforms and institutions has not been rigorously verified.PurposeTo validate quantitative measurement of MR biomarkers on multiple instruments at different institutions.Study TypePhantom validation between platforms and institutions.Phantom ModelT1/susceptibility phantom, two‐compartment dynamic flow phantom.Field Strength/Sequence3T/QSM, T1 mapping, dynamic 2D SPGR.AssessmentPhilips Ingenia, Siemens Prisma, and Siemens Skyra at three different institutions were assessed. A QSM phantom with concentrations of gadolinium, corresponding to magnetic susceptibilities of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 ppm was assayed. DCEQP was assessed by measuring a MultiHance bolus as the consistency of the width ratio of the curves at the input and outputs over a range of flow ratios between outputs.Statistical TestsEach biomarker was assessed by measures of accuracy (Pearson correlation), precision (paired t‐test between repeated measurements), and reproducibility (analysis of covariance ANCOVA] between instruments).ResultsQSM accuracy of r2 > 0.997 on all three platforms was measured. Precision (P = 0.66 Achieva, P = 0.76 Prisma, P = 0.69 Skyra) and reproducibility (P = 0.89) were good. T1 mapping of accuracy was r2 > 0.98.

abstract={In many experiments, several observations are taken over time or with several treatments applied to each subject. These observations tend to be highly correlated, particularly those observed adjacent to each other with respect to time. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the correlations among observations in one‐way and two‐way ANOVA. A modification of the standard tests suitable for AR(1) correlation structure is proposed and its properties are investigated. We also apply the approximations to the distribution of F tests as suggested by some authors in the past and carry out the analysis. The modified procedure allows us to have a better control of the nominal significance level α. Consequently, the multiple comparisons and multiple tests based on this modified procedure will lead to conclusions with better accuracy.},

Data were collected from 415 elementary school students, including 232 (56%) girls and 183 (44%) boys, in grades three to six in Saudi Arabia. The psychometric properties of the scale were examined using the Rasch analysis procedures. The results did not support the unidimensionality of the 36-item scale. Dividing items based on whether they are negatively or positively phrased improved the scale fit. Both the 15-item (positive phrasing) and the 18-item (negative phrasing) scales were supported by the Rasch analysis as unidimensional scales.},

abstract={Head motion occurring during brain PET studies leads to image blurring and to bias in measured local quantities. The objective of this work was to implement a correction method for PET data acquired with the mMR synchronous PET/MR scanner. Methods: A list-mode–based motion-correction approach has been designed. The developed rebinner chronologically reads the recorded events from the Siemens list-mode file, applies the estimated geometric transformations, and frames the detected counts into sinograms. The rigid-body motion parameters were estimated from an initial dynamic reconstruction of the PET data. We then optimized the correction for 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PIB) scans using simulated and actual data with well-controlled motion. Results: An efficient list-mode–based motion correction approach has been implemented, fully optimized, and validated using simulated and actual PET data. The average spatial resolution loss induced by inaccuracies in motion parameter estimates and by the rebinning process was estimated to correspond to a 1-mm increase in full width at half maximum with motion parameters estimated directly from the PET data with a temporal frequency of 20 s. The results show that the rebinner can be safely applied to the 11C-PIB scans, allowing almost complete removal of motion-induced artifacts. The application of the correction method to a large cohort of 11C-PIB scans led to the following observations: first, that more than 21% of the scans were affected by motion greater than 10 mm (39% for subjects with Mini–Mental State Examination scores below 20), and second, that the correction led to quantitative changes in Alzheimer-specific cortical regions of up to 30%. Conclusion: The rebinner allows accurate motion correction at a cost of minimal resolution reduction. Application of the correction to a large cohort of 11C-PIB scans confirmed the necessity of systematically correcting for motion to obtain quantitative results.},

abstract={Introduction: Cardiac PET-MR has shown promising results for the comprehensive assessment of coronary artery disease 1]. A recently proposed framework for simultaneous motion corrected PET/MR imaging allows the visualisation of myocardial metabolic integrity by 18F-FDG PET and coronary lumen integrity by Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) in a single efficient examination 2]. Here we present an initial clinical validation of this method in a cohort of patients with known cardiovascular disease. Methods: The proposed method consists in an ECG-triggered free-breathing sequence simultaneously acquired with list-mode cardiac PET data. Respiratory motion is estimated from MR images and used to correct the MR data while simultaneously providing non-rigid motion fields for MR-based PET respiratory motion correction for both the emission data and attenuation maps. Fourteen patients (66.1±9.5 years) with chronic total occlusion (CTO) of at least one coronary artery were scanned on a Biograph mMR scanner (Siemens Healthcare). Clinical PET-MR imaging included a 40 to 50 min insulin-clamped 18F-FDG list-mode PET acquisition, the proposed PET-CMRA framework 2], and a 2D-PSIR Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) acquisition. CMRA and PET data were reconstructed with the proposed motion correction scheme (MC) 2] and without motion correction (NMC). PET image reconstruction was performed offline using reconstruct-transform-average 3] motion correction in Siemens e7 Tools (OSEM, 3 iterations, 21 subsets, PSF modelling, 2.03x2.08x2.08mm voxel size, 127x344x344 matrix size). RESULTS: Average acquisition time for the proposed PET-CMRA acquisition was 11.2±2.4 minutes. Two patients were excluded as there was no overlap between the PET and the MR acquisition, and one patient for was not being able to receive Gadolinium-based contrast agent. MR images were reformatted to simultaneously visualize the left and right coronary arteries. MC MR images showed sufficient quality for depicting the proximal coronary anatomy (Fig1a), which was in agreement with X-ray angiography (not shown). For PET images, motion correction improved visualisation of small structures as well as delineation of myocardial defects (Fig1b). The degree of transmurality of viability defects was better depicted in MC PET images and an improved agreement with the LGE was observed. Integral tracer in the LV myocardium as quantified with a volumetric analysis, increased significantly especially in inferior and lateral regions after motion correction, indicating improved signal recovery of myocardial tracer uptake. Conclusions: We have presented the clinical validation of a novel respiratory motion-corrected cardiac PET-MR framework for simultaneous visualization of coronary anatomy and myocardial integrity in patients with coronary artery disease. Motion corrected 18F-FDG PET images were in good agreement with LGE-MRI and show a more accurate depiction of both transmural and non-transmural viability defects. REFERENCES: 1] Rischpler C et al.

abstract={OBJECTIVEThe aim of the present study was to compare the performance of positron emission tomography (PET) component of PET/computed tomography (CT) with new emerging PET/magnetic resonance (MR) of the same vendor.METHODSAccording to National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU2-07, five separate experimental tests were performed to evaluate the performance of PET scanner of General Electric GE company; SIGNATM model PET/MR and GE Discovery 710 model PET/CT. The main investigated aspects were spatial resolution, sensitivity, scatter fraction, count rate performance, image quality, count loss and random events correction accuracy.RESULTSThe findings of this study demonstrated superior sensitivity (~ 4 folds) of PET scanner in PET/MR compared to PET/CT system. Image quality test exhibited higher contrast in PET/MR (~ 9%) compared with PET/CT. The scatter fraction of PET/MR was 43.4% at noise equivalent count rate (NECR) peak of 218 kcps and the corresponding activity concentration was 17.7 kBq/cc. Whereas the scatter fraction of PET/CT was found as 39.2% at NECR peak of 72 kcps and activity concentration of 24.3 kBq/cc. The percentage error of the random event correction accuracy was 3.4% and 3.1% in PET/MR and PET/CT, respectively.CONCLUSIONIt was concluded that PET/MR system is about 4 times more sensitive than PET/CT, and the contrast of hot lesions in PET/MR was ~ 9% higher than PET/CT. These outcomes also emphasize the possibility to achieve excellent clinical PET images with low administered dose and/or a short acquisition time in PET/MR.},

abstract={The faults diagnosis of induction motors is an important area of research that has been increasingly developed in recent years. This interest is due to the development and improvement of control circuits making the induction motor very used by researchers and industrials. In this regard, several techniques are used in fault diagnosis based on the stator current analysis by applying signal processing techniques. Indeed, the periodogram technique is the most used technique but has several disadvantages associated with its low frequency resolution leading to a difficult localization of faults harmonics, even an impossible localization in some cases of incipient faults. To solve this problem, a new technique based on the auto-regressive modeling of the stator current is used in this paper, thus improving the frequency resolution at the expense of important computation time. To this end, two improvements are proposed to reduce the computation time while providing a better readability of the stator current spectrum with the use of the proposed technique. In this aim, several simulation and experimental tests are achieved in the case of bearing cage fault and rotor faults to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

abstract={Objectives: Both absolute quantification and comparisons of clinical data to normal datasets in PET imaging requires accurate attenuation correction (AC). Due to the lack of signal from bone in conventional MR images, AC is challenging in PET/MR brain examinations. Recently it was shown that Zero Echo Time (ZTE) MR sequences allow to image bone which can be used for AC in PET/MR (ZTEAC). In this study, we aim to validate the accuracy of ZTEAC compared to CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) in 18F]FDG brain examinations of dementia patients. Methods: PET/MR raw data sets (60 - 85 min. p.i.) of 9 subjects suspected for dementia were reconstructed using ZTEAC (PETZTEAC) and CTAC (PETCTAC) in the GE PET reconstruction toolbox v.1.26 (static TOF-OSEM reconstruction, 4 iterations, 28 subsets). The acquired ZTE MR images were converted to PET attenuation images using a vendor-provided research tool. The CTAC attenuation images, including templates for the bed and MR-coils was derived from low-dose AC-CTs of a PET/CT examination acquired immediately before on a Siemens HIREZ PET/CT. The AC-CT was rigidly co-registered and bi-linearly scaled to PET attenuation coefficients. Subsequently, relative differences in the 18F]FDG uptake in 86 anatomical regions of the Hammers atlas defined in PMOD v3.7 (PMOD, Zurich, Switzerland) were calculated and analyzed in R v3.0.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). We also calculated the same quantities for PETGEAC that was reconstructed with GE atlas-based attenuation images (GEAC) used as standard routine option on the system. Results: The bias (mean ± SD) in the uptake of PETZTEAC / PETGEAC compared to PETCTAC was: (-0.26 ± 2.07 / -0.43 ± 2.89)% averaged over all regions, (-0.6 ± 2.1 / -0.3 ± 3.1)% in cortical grey matter, (0.4 ± 1.7 / 0.5 ± 1.4)% in the striatum ,(-0.5 ± 1.2 / 1.8 ± 1.1)% in white matter, and (-0.2 ± 3.6 / -2.70 ± 2.9)% in the cerebellum. In all patients, the intra-patient variability in the bias of PETZTEAC was smaller than in PETGEAC. The bias of PETGEAC showed a 7% gradient in the cranio-caudal direction across the brain which was not apparent in PETZTEAC. Conclusion: In the analyzed PET/MR brain examinations, ZTEAC improves regional PET quantification compared to GEAC, especially in infratentorial areas, with almost no bias compared to CTAC throughout the brain.},

abstract={Objectives: The study objective was to validate a recently introduced non-invasive image derived input function (IDIF) estimation method with the gold standard arterial blood sampling. Methods: Six subjects (31-50 years old) were injected with 408±62 MBq of 15O-water simultaneously with the start of a 10 min PET scan on the SIGNA PET-MR (GE Healthcare, WI, Waukesha). During PET scanning, a sagittal vascular (inhance 3D velocity) MR series was used with the following parameters: TR=8.7 ms, TE=4.1 ms, FOV=24x21.6 cm, slice thickness=3 mm, 32 slices, velocity encoding=40, phase acceleration=2.0, and scan time=1:21 min. The PET list file was unlisted for every second and total true and scatter coincident events were plotted to identify tracer arrival into the brain arteries. Then, a short time frame over the arrival of the tracer to the cervical region was reconstructed to obtain a PET angiogram. The cervical arteries were then segmented using the MR vascular images and PETA images. Spill-over and spill- in artifacts were estimated using PETA images and the actual arterial volume was measured from the MR vascular images. The PET list file was unlisted and images were reconstructed for every 1 s for the first 30 s, every 3 s for the next 30 s, every 5 s for the 2nd minute, every 10 s for the 3rd and 4th minute and every 30 s for 5th to 10th minutes. The AIF was estimated by dividing total counts from the cervical arteries of each frame by the MR-based arterial volume. For each patient, blood samples were continuously drawn from the radial artery at the wrist using a peristaltic pump, and the tracer concentration in the arterial blood was measured using a Twilite two detector (Swisstrace) to estimate the AIF. In order to calculate the AIF at the brain arteries from these blood samples, the delay and dispersion of the arterial input function was corrected using standard PET-based methods. The CBF and distribution volume were calculated using both the IDIF method and the blood samples by minimizing the mean square of the error between the PET observations and model fit using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm in MATLAB (Mathworks, Wilmington, MA). Results: Figure 1 shows the (a) PETA and (b) MR vascular images for one of the patients. The PETA images clearly show the arteries and the extent of the spill-over. Figure 2 compares the AIF curve estimated by the proposed IDIF method and the AIF curve measured by the blood samples. The comparison shows excellent correspondence between the IDIF method and the gold standard blood sampling method with 9% and 11% difference for the 1st pass and the entire AIF, respectively. The IDIF captures the AIF peak correctly and has increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to the blood sampling method. The delay and the dispersion of the AIF curve is nearly identical between the two methods. The CBF over the whole brain was measured 29.5±8.7 and 27.0±14 ml/s/100g with the AIF measured by IDIF method and blood samples, respectively with a mean difference of 14% between the two methods. The volume distribution over the whole brain was measured 0.5±0.1 for both methods with a mean difference of 15% between them. Conclusion: As the results show, the proposed method is capable of determining a high fidelity IDIF from simultaneous PET/MRI data. Having a "blood-free" method that obviates the need for direct arterial sampling is of benefit to both investigators and their subjects, because of the high costs, inconvenience, and potential risks associated with arterial cannulation. It has applications beyond 15O-water PET, enabling pharmacokinetic modeling to be performed that is required for quantitative PET tracer studies.},

abstract={Purpose Ongoing discussions occur to translate the safety restrictions on MR scanners from specific absorption rate (SAR) to thermal dose. Therefore, this research focuses on the accuracy of thermal simulations in human subjects during an MR exam, which is fundamental information in that debate. Methods Radiofrequency (RF) heating experiments were performed on the calves of 13 healthy subjects using a dedicated transmit-receive coil while monitoring the temperature with proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) thermometry. Subject-specific models and one generic model were used for electromagnetic and thermal simulations using Pennes' bioheat equation, with the blood equilibration constant equaling zero. The simulations were subsequently compared with the experimental results. Results The mean B 1 + equaled 15 µT in the center slice of all volunteers, and 95% of the voxels had errors smaller than 2.8 µT between the simulation and measurement. The intersubject variation in RF power to achieve the required B 1 + was 11%. The resulting intersubject variation in median temperature rise was 14%. Thermal simulations underestimated the median temperature increase on average, with 34% in subject-specific models and 28% in the generic model. Conclusions Although thermal measures are directly coupled to tissue damage and therefore suitable for RF safety assessment, insecurities in the applied thermal modeling limit their estimation accuracy.

abstract={Haptic display units have been widely used for conveying button sensations to users, primarily employing vibrotactile actuators. However, the human feeling for pressing buttons mainly relies on kinaesthetic sensations (rather than vibrotactile sensations), and little studies exist on small-scale kinaesthetic haptic units. Thus, the primary goals of this paper are to design a miniature kinaesthetic actuator based on Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid that can convey various button-clicking sensations and to experimentally evaluate its haptic performance. The design focuses of the proposed actuator were to produce sufficiently large actuation forces (resistive forces) for human users in a given size constraint and to offer a wide range of actuation forces for conveying vivid haptic sensations to users. To this end, this study first performed a series of parametric studies using mathematical force models for multiple operating modes of MR fluid in conjunction with finite element electromagnetism analysis. After selecting design parameters based on parametric studies, a prototype actuator was constructed, and its performance was evaluated using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. It measured the actuator’s resistive force with a varying stroke (pressed depth) up to 1 mm and a varying input current from 0 A to 200 mA. The results show that the proposed actuator creates a wide range of resistive forces from around 2 N (off-state) to over 9.5 N at 200 mA. In order to assess the prototype’s performance in the terms of the haptic application prospective, a maximum force rate was calculated to determine just noticeable difference in force changes for the 1 mm stoke of the actuator. The results show that the force rate is sufficient to mimic various levels of button sensations, indicating that the proposed kinaesthetic actuator can offer a wide range of resistive force changes that can be conveyed to human operators.},

abstract={Ecological validity should be the cornerstone of any assessment of cognitive functioning. For this purpose, we have developed a preliminary study to test the Art Gallery Test (AGT) as an alternative to traditional neuropsychological testing. The AGT involves three visual search subtests displayed in a virtual reality (VR) art gallery, designed to assess visual attention within an ecologically valid setting. To evaluate the relation between AGT and standard neuropsychological assessment scales, data were collected on a normative sample of healthy adults (n = 30). The measures consisted of concurrent paper-and-pencil neuropsychological measures Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Color Trails Test (CTT)] along with the outcomes from the three subtests of the AGT. The results showed significant correlations between the AGT subtests describing different visual search exercises strategies with global and specific cognitive measures. Comparative visual search was associated with attention and cognitive flexibility (CTT); whereas visual searches involving pictograms correlated with global cognitive function (MoCA).},

abstract={INTRODUCTION Identification of cancer biomarkers that inform clinical decisions and reduce the use of ineffective therapies is a major goal of precision oncology. An abnormal splice variant of the androgen receptor, AR-V7, was recently found to confer resistance to novel hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but did not negatively affect responses to taxane chemotherapies, suggesting that early use of chemotherapy may be a more effective option for AR-V7(+) patients. METHODS We calculated the cost savings of performing AR-V7 testing in mCRPC patients prior to starting abiraterone/enzalutamide (and avoiding these drugs in AR-V7(+) men) versus treating all mCRPC patients empirically with abiraterone/enzalutamide (without use of the biomarker). RESULTS We determined that AR-V7 testing would result in substantial cost savings as long as the true prevalence of AR-V7 was >5%. In our prior studies, we estimated that approximately 30% of mCRPC patients may have detectable AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In this population, upfront testing of AR-V7 status (at a price of $1,000 per test) would result in a net cost savings of $150 Million in the United States per year. CONCLUSIONS AR-V7 testing in mCRPC patients would be cost-beneficial when considering the current price of treatment, and may reduce the ineffective use of abiraterone/enzalutamide, leading to a significant net cost savings to the healthcare system. Clinical-grade AR-V7 testing is currently available at our institution. Prostate 76:1484-1490, 2016.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:A comprehensive parameter model was developed to investigate correlations between cerebral hemodynamics and alterations in the extracranial venous circulation due to posture changes and/or extracranial venous obstruction (stenosis). The purpose of this work was to validate the simulation results by using MR imaging and echo-color Doppler experimental blood flow data in humans.MATERIALS AND METHODS:To validate the model outcomes, we used supine average arterial and venous extracerebral blood flow, obtained by using phase-contrast MR imaging from 49 individuals with stenosis in the acquisition plane at the level of the disc between the second and third vertebrae of the left internal jugular vein, 20 with stenosis in the acquisition plane at the level of the disc between the fifth and sixth vertebrae of the right internal jugular vein, and 38 healthy controls without stenosis. Average data from a second group of 10 healthy volunteers screened with an echo-color Doppler technique were used to evaluate flow variations due to posture change.RESULTS:There was excellent agreement between experimental and simulated supine flows. Every simulated CBF fell inside the standard error from the corresponding average experimental value, as well as most of the simulated extracerebral arterial flow (extracranial blood flow from the head and face, measured at the level of the disc between second and third vertebrae) and venous flows. Simulations of average jugular and vertebral blood flow variations due to a change of posture from supine to upright also matched the experimental data.CONCLUSIONS:The good agreement between simulated and experimental results means that the model can correctly reproduce the main factors affecting the extracranial circulation and could be used to study other types of stenotic conditions not represented by the experimental data.},

abstract={Purpose To determine the test-retest reproducibility of neurochemical concentrations obtained with a highly optimized, short-echo, single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) pulse sequence at 3T and 7T using state-of-the-art hardware. Methods A semi-LASER sequence (echo time=26-28 ms) was used to acquire spectra from the posterior cingulate and cerebellum at 3T and 7T from six healthy volunteers who were scanned four times weekly on both scanners. Spectra were quantified with LCModel. Results More neurochemicals were quantified with mean Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) ≤20% at 7T than at 3T despite comparable frequency-domain signal-to-noise ratio. Whereas CRLBs were lower at 7T (P<0.05), between-session coefficients of variance (CVs) were comparable at the two fields with 64 transients. Five metabolites were quantified with between-session CVs ≤5% at both fields. Analysis of subspectra showed that a minimum achievable CV was reached with a lower number of transients at 7T for multiple metabolites and that between-session CVs were lower at 7T than at 3T with fewer than 64 transients. Conclusion State-of-the-art MRS methodology allows excellent reproducibility for many metabolites with 5-min data averaging on clinical 3T hardware. Sensitivity and resolution advantages at 7T are important for weakly represented metabolites, short acquisitions, and small volumes of interest.

abstract={Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) mild hyperthermia in deep tissue targets for enhancing radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the context of recurrent rectal cancer. A preclinical study was performed to evaluate the safety and performance of MR-HIFU mild hyperthermia. A prospective imaging study was performed in volunteers with rectal cancer to evaluate MR thermometry quality near the rectum and accessibility of rectal tumors using MR-HIFU. Methods and Materials: Mild hyperthermia was performed in pig thigh (9 sonications, 6 pigs) using a clinical MR-HIFU system. Targets near the rectal wall and deep thigh were evaluated. Thermal maps obtained in 6 planes every 3.2 seconds were used to control sonications in 18-mm diameter treatment regions at temperatures of 42 degree C to 42.5 degree C for 10 to 60 minutes. Volunteer imaging-only studies to assess the quality of MR thermometry (without heating) were approved by the institutional research ethics board. Anatomic and MR thermometry images were acquired in consenting volunteers with rectal cancer. In 3 of 6 study participants, rectal filling with saline was used to reduce motion-related MR thermometry artifacts near the tumor. Results: In pigs, mean target temperature matched the desired hyperthermia temperature within 0.2 degree C; temporal standard deviation less than or equal to 0.5 degree C. With optimized control thresholds, no undesired tissue damage was observed. In human volunteers, MR temperature measurements had adequate precision and stability, especially when rectal filling was used to reduce bowel motion. Conclusions: In pigs, MR-HIFU can safely deliver mild hyperthermia (41 degree C-43 degree C) to a targeted volume for 30 minutes. In humans, careful patient selection and preparation will enable adequate targeting for recurrent rectal cancers and sufficient MR temperature mapping stability to control mild hyperthermia. These results enable human trials of MR-HIFU hyperthermia.},

abstract={The aim was to determine the proton MR (1H-MR) spectra of normal adult testes and variations with age. Forty-one MR spectra of normal testes, including 16 testes from men aged 20-39 years (group I) and 25 testes from men aged 40-69 years (group II), were analyzed. A single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS), with TR/TE: 2000/25 ms was used. The volume of interest was placed to include the majority of normal testicular parenchyma. Association between normalized metabolite concentrations, defined as ratios of the calculated metabolite concentrations relative to creatine concentration, and age was assessed. Quantified metabolites of the spectra were choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mI), scyllo-inositol, taurine, lactate, GLx compound, glucose, lipids, and macromolecules resonating at 0.9 ppm (LM09), around 20 ppm (LM20), and at 13 ppm (LM13). Most prominent peaks were Cho, Cr, mI, and lipids. A weak negative correlation between mI and age (P=0.015) was observed. Higher normalized concentrations of Cho (P=0.03), mI (P=0.08), and LM13 (P=0.05) were found in group I than in group II. 1H-MR spectra of a normal adult testis showed several metabolite peaks.

abstract={The accurate identification of glioblastoma progression remains an unmet clinical need. The aim of this prospective single-institutional study is to determine and validate thresholds for the main metabolite concentrations obtained by MR spectroscopy (MRS) and the values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to enable distinguishing tumor recurrence from pseudoprogression. Thirty-nine patients after the standard treatment of a glioblastoma underwent advanced imaging by MRS and ADC at the time of suspected recurrence - median time to progression was 6.7 months. The highest significant sensitivity and specificity to call the glioblastoma recurrence was observed for the total choline (tCho) to total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) concentration ratio with the threshold ≥ 1.3 (sensitivity 100.0% and specificity 94.7%). The ADCmean value higher than 1313 × 10(- 6) mm(2)/s was associated with the pseudoprogression (sensitivity 98.3%, specificity 100.0%). The combination of MRS focused on the tCho/tNAA concentration ratio and the ADCmean value represents imaging methods applicable to early non-invasive differentiation between a glioblastoma recurrence and a pseudoprogression. However, the institutional definition and validation of thresholds for differential diagnostics is needed for the elimination of setup errors before implementation of these multimodal imaging techniques into clinical practice, as well as into clinical trials.},

abstract={The effectiveness of the various control algorithms for semi-active structural control systems proposed in the literature is highly questionable when dealing with earthquake actions, which never reach a steady state. From this perspective, the paper summarizes the results of an experimental activity aimed to compare the effectiveness of four different semi-active control algorithms on a structural mock up representative of a class of structural systems particularly prone to seismic actions. The controlled structure is a near full scale 2-story steel frame, equipped with two semi-active bracing systems including two magnetorheological dampers designed and manufactured in Europe. A set of earthquake records has been applied at the base of the structure, by utilizing a shaking table facility. Experimental results are compared in terms of displacements, absolute accelerations and energy dissipation capability. A further analysis on the percentage incidence of undesired and/or unpredictable operations corresponding to each algorithm gives an insight on some factors affecting the reliability and, in turn, the real effectiveness of semi-active structural control systems.},

abstract={Purpose To compare the vessel size and the cerebral blood volume in human gliomas with histopathology. Vessel size imaging (VSI) is a dynamic susceptibility contrast method for the assessment of the vessel size in normal and pathological tissue. Previous publications in rodents showed a satisfactory conformity with the vessel size derived from histopathology. To assess the clinical value, further, the progression-free interval was determined and correlated. Materials and Methods Twenty-five gliomas (WHO grade degree II n = 10], degree III n = 3], degree IV n = 12]) were prospectively included and received a stereotaxic biopsy after VSI. The vessel size and the cerebral blood volume (CBV) were calculated in regions of interest at the tumor edge and correlated with the vessel size measured by histopathology. Results Both VSI and CBV showed a good correlation with the vessel size in histopathology (up to r = 0.84, P < 0.001, and r = 0.62, P < 0.001, respectively). Slope and offset of the linear regression (y = 0.77x + 0.36 mu m) suggest that the size of normal capillaries is overestimated with VSI, while for grossly enlarged vessels an underestimation occurs. Both VSI and CBV were negatively correlated with the progression-free interval (r = -0.57, P = 0.008, and r = -0.50, P = 0.025, respectively). Conclusion The correlation between VSI and vessel size from histopathology is in good accordance with the animal studies. The overestimation of small capillary sizes is also known from the animal trials. Vessel size and CBV showed similar results, both for the correlation with the histopathological vessel size and the progression-free interval. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015; 42:1117-1125.},

abstract={The level set approach to segmentation of medical images has received considerable attention in recent years. Evolving an initial contour to converge to anatomical boundaries of an organ or tumor is a very appealing method, especially when it is based on a well-defined mathematical foundation. However, one drawback of such evolving method is its high computation time. It is desirable to design and implement algorithms that are not only accurate and robust but also fast in execution. Bresson et al. have proposed a variational model using both boundary and region information as well as shape priors. The latter can be a significant factor in medical image analysis. In this work, we combine the variational model of level set with a multi-resolution approach to accelerate the processing. The question is whether a multi-resolution context can make the segmentation faster without affecting the accuracy. As well, we investigate the question whether a premature convergence, which happens in a much shorter time, would reduce accuracy. We examine multiple semiautomated configurations to segment the prostate gland in T2W MR images. Comprehensive experimentation is conducted using a data set of a 100 patients (1,235 images) to verify the effectiveness of the multi-resolution level set with shape priors. The results show that the convergence speed can be increased by a factor of approximately 2.5 without affecting the segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, a premature convergence approach drastically increases the segmentation speed by a factor of approximately 17.9.},

abstract={Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ) is one of the most important parameters determining groundwater flow and contaminant transport in both unsaturated and saturated porous media. The hand-held air permeameter technique was investigated for high-resolution hydraulic conductivity determination on borehole cores using a spatial resolution of ∼0.05 m. The suitability of such air permeameter measurements on friable to poorly indurated sediments was tested to improve the spatial prediction of classical laboratory-based Kₛmeasurements obtained at a much lower spatial resolution (∼2 m). In total, 368 Kₛmeasurements were made on ∼350 m of borehole cores originating from the Campine basin, northern Belgium, while ∼5,230 air permeability measurements were performed on the same cores, resulting in a Kₛrange of seven orders of magnitude. Cross-validation demonstrated that, using air permeameter data as the secondary variable for laboratory based Kₛmeasurements, the performance increased from R² = 0.35 for ordinary kriging (laboratory Kₛonly) to R² = 0.61 for co-kriging. The separate treatment of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity revealed considerable anisotropy in certain lithostratigraphical units, while others were clearly isotropic at the sample scale. Air permeameter measurements on borehole cores provide a cost-effective way to improve spatial predictions of traditional laboratory based Kₛ.},

abstract={Purpose Vessel-encoded (VE) pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (p-CASL) is a territorial ASL (T-ASL) technique to identify the perfusion territories of cerebral arteries. The aim of this study was to validate the output of three Vessel-encoded p-CASL image processing methods, k-means clustering with and without subsequent linear analysis and a Bayesian framework, by comparison with the perfusion maps acquired with super-selective p-CASL. Methods The comparison was done quantitatively using the Hausdorff distance and Dice similarity coefficient in the territories of the right and left internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the right and left vertebral arteries. A qualitative comparison was done in the areas of the anterior and posterior circulation, and the deep gray matter. Results The overall agreement between the Vessel-encoded p-CASL image processing methods and super-selective p-CASL was good; with the difference that the linear analysis and the Bayesian framework were able to detect mixed perfusion. Conclusion Planning-free Vessel-encoded p-CASL with k-means clustering appears suitable as a general purpose T-ASL strategy, but to determine mixed perfusion a combination with linear analysis, or the Bayesian framework is preferable, which are superior in this regard. To accurately determine the perfusion territory of a single vessel, super-selective p-CASL is still recommended. Magn Reson Med 71:2059-2070, 2014. copyright 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Specific ventilation imaging (SVI) uses proton MRI to quantitatively map the distribution of specific ventilation (SV) in the human lung, using inhaled oxygen as a contrast agent. To validate this recent technique, we compared the quantitative measures of heterogeneity of the SV distribution in a 15-mm sagittal slice of lung obtained in 10 healthy supine subjects, (age 37 ± 10 yr, forced expiratory volume in 1 s 97 ± 7% predicted) using SVI to those obtained in the whole lung from multiple-breath nitrogen washout (MBW). Using the analysis of Lewis et al. (Lewis SM, Evans JW, Jalowayski AA. J App Physiol 44: 416-423, 1978), the most likely distribution of SV from the MBW data was computed and compared with the distribution of SV obtained from SVI, after normalizing for the difference in tidal volume. The average SV was 0.30 ± 0.10 MBW, compared with 0.36 ± 0.10 SVI (P = 0.01). The width of the distribution, a measure of the heterogeneity, obtained using both methods was comparable: 0.51 ± 0.06 and 0.47 ± 0.08 in MBW and SVI, respectively (P = 0.15). The MBW estimated width of the SV distribution was 0.05 (10.7%) higher than that estimated using SVI, and smaller than the intertest variability of the MBW estimation inter-MBW (SD) for the width of the SV distribution was 0.08 (15.8)%]. To assess reliability, SVI was performed twice on 13 subjects showing small differences between measurements of SV heterogeneity (typical error 0.05, 12%). In conclusion, quantitative estimations of SV heterogeneity from SVI are reliable and similar to those obtained using MBW, with SVI providing spatial information that is absent in MBW.

abstract={Employing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AR - )-Bounds testing approach, and using GDP - excluding the contributions from oil and gas, as well as the financial services sector - as the growth indicator between 1969 and 2008, the paper establishes a long-run relationship between economic growth and financial liberalisation, which is represented by an index. This index is calculated by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The paper finds that financial liberalisation policies have a positive and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria - both in the short run and in the long run. The study, therefore, recommends that appropriate financial liberalisation policies should be pursued in Nigeria, in order to foster economic growth. However, considering the fact that financial markets are prone to market failures, the study cautions against adopting a laissez-faire approach to financial reforms.

abstract={This article examines the relationship between stock market development and sustainable economic growth in Ghana. The study employs the recently developed AR - -bounds testing approach and multidimensional stock market development proxies to examine this linkage. The article finds that in the long run, stock market developments and capital account liberalization policies have no positive effect on economic growth in Ghana. This finding supports the numerous past studies, which have reported negative or inconclusive results on the effects of stock market development on economic growth. The article, therefore, concludes that it is the increase in credit to the private sector, rather than stock market development that drives the real sector development in Ghana.

abstract={Background: The North American Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (NA-ADNI) was the first program to develop standardized procedures for Alzheimers disease (AD) imaging biomarker collection. Objective: We describe the validation of acquisition and processing of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in different Italian academic AD clinics following NA-ADNI procedures. Methods: 373 patients with subjective memory impairment (n = 12), mild cognitive impairment (n = 92), Alzheimers dementia (n = 253), and frontotemporal dementia (n = 16) were enrolled in 9 Italian centers. 22 cognitively healthy elderly controls were also included. MRI site qualification and MP-RAGE quality assessment was applied following the NA-ADNI procedures. Indices of validity were: (i) NA-ADNI phantoms signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio, (ii) proportion of images passing quality control, (iii) comparability of automated intracranial volume (ICV) estimates across scanners, and (iv) known-group validity of manual hippocampal volumetry. Results: Results on Phantom and Volunteers scans showed that I-ADNI acquisition parameters were comparable with those one of the ranked-A ADNI scans. Eighty-seven percent of I-ADNI MPRAGE images were ranked of high quality in comparison of 69% of NA-ADNI. ICV showed homogeneous variances across scanners except for Siemens scanners at 3.0 Tesla (p = 0.039). A significant difference in hippocampal volume was found between AD and controls on 1.5 Tesla scans (p 0.001), confirming known group validity test. Conclusion: This study has provided standardization of MRI acquisition and imaging marker collection across different Italian clinical units and equipment. This is a mandatory step to the implementation of imaging biomarkers in clinical routine for early and differential diagnosis.},

note={Copyright - Copyright Elsevier Science Ltd. Jul 2013; Last updated - 2023-11-23},
abstract={We know very little about the performance of point optimal (PO) and approximate point optimal (APO) tests in the presence of unavoidable nuisance parameters. Because marginal likelihood based tests are said to perform well in the presence of unavoidable nuisance parameters, this paper compares the performance of marginal likelihood based APO tests and classical tests using a testing problem which has been largely overlooked by econometric practitioners, namely testing for a static linear regression model with AR(1) errors against a dynamic linear regression model with white noise errors. It is well known that the classical tests are specifically designed for nested testing, they are applied to test for the significance of the dynamic coefficient of a dynamic linear regression model with AR(1) errors. A testing procedure is proposed, where the size and power comparisons used are based on near-exact non-similar critical values of tests obtained using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, as the near-exact non-similar critical values control the sizes of the tests well overall. Among marginal likelihood based classical tests, the likelihood ratio (LR) test and Lagrange multiplier (LM) test seem to perform well under the alternative hypothesis, particularly when the dynamic parameter is large and the sample size is reasonably big. The Wald (W) test is the worst performer overall. This concurs with previous observations that the W test performs poorly in small samples. Compared to the classical approach, APO tests appear to have good power properties, particularly in the neighborhood of the chosen parameter point under the alternative hypothesis. This finding may advance the use of PO and APO tests. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Our aim is to test the hypothesis of normality for the innovations in a completely non‐parametric way, that is, without imposing parametric assumptions on the conditional mean and volatility functions. To this end, the Cramér–von Mises test based on the empirical distribution function of non‐parametrically estimated residuals is shown to be asymptotically distribution‐free. We demonstrate its good performance for finite sample sizes in a small simulation study. // ABSTRACT IN : AMS 2010 Classification: Primary 62 M10, Secondary 62 G10 Reprinted by permission of Blackwell Publishers},

abstract={Objectives: Compared with X-ray coronary angiography (CAG), magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary vessel wall (MR-CVW) may provide more information about plaque burden and coronary remodelling. We compared MR-CVW with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), the standard of reference for coronary vessel wall imaging, with regard to plaque detection and wall thickness measurements. Methods: In this study 17 patients with chest pain, who had been referred for CAG, were included. Patients underwent IVUS and MR-CVW imaging of the right coronary artery (RCA). Subsequently, the coronary vessel wall was analysed for the presence and location of coronary plaques. Results: Fifty-two matching RCA regions of interest were available for comparison. There was good agreement between IVUS and MR-CVW for qualitative assessment of presence of disease, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 76%. Wall thickness measurements demonstrated a significant difference between mean wall thickness on IVUS and MR-CVW (0.48 vs 1.24 mm, P<0.001), but great heterogeneity between wall thickness measurements, resulting in a low correlation between IVUS and MR-CVW. Conclusions: MR-CVW has high sensitivity for the detection of coronary vessel wall thickening in the RCA compared with IVUS. However, the use of MRI for accurate absolute wall thickness measurements is not supported when a longitudinal acquisition orientation is used. Key Points : times Both MRI and IVUS can assess coronary vessels times Both MRI and IVUS can identify coronary vessel wall thickening. times MRI provides more information about the coronary plaque burden than conventional angiography. times However, MRI overestimates absolute coronary wall thickness when compared with IVUS.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop and validate a method to identify computationally efficient site- and patient-specific models of ultrasound thermal therapies from MR thermal images. The models of the specific absorption rate of the transduced energy and the temperature response of the therapy target are identified in the reduced basis of proper orthogonal decomposition of thermal images, acquired in response to a mild thermal test excitation. The method permits dynamic reidentification of the treatment models during the therapy by recursively utilizing newly acquired images. Such adaptation is particularly important during high-temperature therapies, which are known to substantially and rapidly change tissue properties and blood perfusion. The developed theory was validated for the case of focused ultrasound heating of a tissue phantom. The experimental and computational results indicate that the developed approach produces accurate low-dimensional treatment models despite temporal and spatial noises in MR images and slow image acquisition rate.},

This project, AR.I.E.T.T.A., aimed to develop a software capable of analysing athletes' hematological and performance profiles to detect abnormal patterns.METHODSOne-hundred eighty athletes belonging to the International Biathlon Union gave written informed consent to have their hematological data, previously collected according to anti-doping rules, used to develop the AR.I.E.T.T.A. software.RESULTSSoftware was developed with the included sections: 1) log-in; 2) data-entry: where data are loaded, stored and grouped; 3) analysis: where data are analysed, validated scores are calculated, and parameters are simultaneously displayed as statistics, tables and graphs, and individual or subpopulation profiles; 4) screening: where an immediate evaluation of the risk score of the present sample and/or the athlete under study is obtained. The sample risk score or AR.I.E.T.T.A. score is calculated by a simple computational system combining different parameters (absolute values and intra-individual variations) considered concurrently. The AR.I.E.T.T.A. score is obtained by the sum of the deviation units derived from each parameter, considering the shift of the present value from the reference values, based on the number of standard deviations.CONCLUSIONAR.I.E.T.T.A. enables a quick evaluation of blood results assisting surveillance programs and perform timely target testing controls on athletes by the International Federations. Future studies aiming to validate the AR.I.E.T.T.A. score and improve the diagnostic accuracy will improve the system.},

abstract={To determine the initial feasibility of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to detect early atherosclerosis, we investigated inflammatory cells labeled with a positive contrast agent in an endothelial cell-based testing system. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was labeled by overnight incubation with a gadolinium colloid (Gado CELLTrack) prior to determination of the in vitro release profile from T1-weighted MR images. Next, MR signals arising from both a synthetic model of THP-1/human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) accumulation and the dynamic adhesion of THP-1 cells to activated HUVECs under flow were obtained. THP-1 cells were found to be successfully--but not optimally--labeled with gadolinium colloid, and MR images demonstrated increased signal from labeled cells in both the synthetic and dynamic THP-1/HUVEC models. The observed THP-1 contrast release profile was rapid, suggesting the need for an agent that is optimized for retention in the target cells for use in further studies. Detection of labeled THP-1 cells was accomplished with no signal enhancement from unlabeled cells. These achievements demonstrate the feasibility of targeting early atherosclerosis with MR imaging, and suggest that using an in vitro system like the one described provides a rapid, efficient, and cost-effective way to support the development and evaluation of novel MR contrast agents.},

abstract={Objective A challenging but main task for clinicians is to identify patients' concerns related to their medical conditions. The study aim was to validate a new coding scheme for identifying patients' cues and concerns. Methods 12 videotaped consultations between nurses and pain patients were coded according to the Verona Coding Scheme for Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES). During a metainterview each patient watched his/her own video interview with the researcher to confirm or disconfirm the identified cues and concerns. A directive or an open format was applied. Quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed. Results Patients' confirmation in relation to the coding gave a sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.99 in the directive format and a sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.70 applying the open format. Through a qualitative analysis 83% of researcher-identified cues and concerns were validated. 17% were not confirmed or uncertain. Conclusion The VR-CoDES seems to capture what are experienced as real concerns to patients, and proves to be a coding scheme with a high degree of ecological validity. Practice implications The VR-CoDES provides a valid framework for detecting patients' cues and concerns, and should be explored as a training tool to develop clinicians' empathic accuracy.

abstract={Magnetorheological (MR) dampers have been widely studied and employed to solve the vibration problem in structures such as buildings and bridges. It is known that MR dampers can generate high damping forces with low-energy requirements and low-cost productions. However, the complex dynamics that characterize MR dampers make difficult the control design to achieve the vibration reduction goals in an efficient manner. In this paper, semiactive controllers based on the backstepping and quantitative feedback theory techniques are proposed and their performances are compared with each other on the problem of vibration control in a structure with an MR damper. They are applied to a large-scale three-story building with an MR damper at its first floor subject to seismic motions. The performance of the proposed controllers is experimentally evaluated by means of real-time hybrid testing scheme that accounts for time delays and actuator dynamics, allowing for the test of velocity-dependent devices.},

abstract={Multimodal approaches are of growing interest in the study of neural processes. To this end much attention has been paid to the integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data because of their complementary properties. However, the simultaneous acquisition of both types of data causes serious artifacts in the EEG, with amplitudes that may be much larger than those of EEG signals themselves. The most challenging of these artifacts is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, caused by pulse-related electrode movements inside the magnetic field. Despite numerous efforts to find a suitable approach to remove this artifact, still a considerable discrepancy exists between current EEG-fMRI studies. This paper attempts to clarify several methodological issues regarding the different approaches with an extensive validation based on event-related potentials (ERPs). More specifically, Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based methods were investigated. Their validation was not only performed with measures known from previous studies on the average ERPs, but most attention was focused on task-related measures, including their use on trial-to-trial information. These more detailed validation criteria enabled us to find a clearer distinction between the most widely used cleaning methods. Both OBS and ICA proved to be able to yield equally good results. However, ICA methods needed more parameter tuning, thereby making OBS more robust and easy to use. Moreover, applying OBS prior to ICA can optimize the data quality even more, but caution is recommended since the effect of the additional ICA step may be strongly subject-dependent.},

abstract={This study proposes magnetic resonance (MR)-measurement-integrated (MR-MI) simulation, in which the difference between the computed velocity field and the phase-contrast MRI measurement data is fed back to the numerical simulation. The computational accuracy and the fundamental characteristics, such as steady characteristics and transient characteristics, of the MR-MI simulation were investigated by a numerical experiment. We dealt with reproduction of three-dimensional steady and unsteady blood flow fields in a realistic cerebral aneurysm developed at a bifurcation. The MR-MI simulation reduced the error derived from the incorrect boundary conditions in the blood flow in the cerebral aneurysm. For the reproduction of steady and unsteady standard solutions, the error of velocity decreased to 13% and to 22% in one cardiac cycle, respectively, compared with the ordinary simulation without feedback. Moreover, the application of feedback shortened the computational convergence, and thus the convergent solution and periodic solution were obtained within less computational time in the MR-MI simulation than that in the ordinary simulation. The dividing flow ratio toward the two outlets after bifurcation was well estimated owing to the improvement of computational accuracy. Furthermore, the MR-MI simulation yielded wall shear stress distribution on the cerebral aneurysm of the standard solution accurately and in detail.},

abstract={Purpose To investigate regional strain response during high-dose dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DS-CMR) using myocardial tagging and Strain-Encoded MR (SENC). Materials and Methods Stress induced ischemia was assessed by wall motion analysis, by tagged CMR and by SENC in 65 patients with suspected or known CAD who underwent DS-CMR in a clinical 1.5 Tesla scanner. Coronary angiography deemed as the standard reference for the presence or absence of CAD (50% diameter stenosis) in all patients. Results SENC and conventional tagging detected abnormal strain response in six and five additional patients, respectively, who were missed by cine images and proved to have CAD by angiography (P < 0.05 for SENC versus cine, P = 0.06 for tagging versus cine and p = NS for SENC versus tagging). On a per-vessel level, wall motion analysis on cine images showed high specificity (95%) but moderate sensitivity (70%) for the detection of CAD. Tagging and SENC yielded significantly higher sensitivity of 81% and 89%, respectively (P < 0.05 for tagging and P < 0.01 for SENC versus wall motion analysis, and p = NS for SENC versus tagging), while specificity was equally high (96% and 94%, respectively, P = NS for all). Conclusion Both the direct color-coded visualization of strain on CMR images and the generation of additional visual markers within the myocardium with tagged CMR represent useful adjuncts for DS-CMR, which may provide incremental value for the detection of CAD in humans.

abstract={Anxiety as a symptom or disorder is affected by multiple variables such as antecedent events, interpretation of the events, psychological vulnerability, and individual differences in the reaction towards an event.

Among the different anxiety disorders, the category of specific phobias (7.1%) was the most common. Based on this demand, a collaborative effort between research groups from the University Jaume I in Spain and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), initiated a project which purpose was the technological transfer of systems based on virtual reality for the treatment of Fear of Flying to be implemented and evaluated in the Mexican population. The treatment protocol developed by Botella et al., 2] has been applied to five volunteer participants.

abstract={The purpose of this work was to validate in phantom studies and demonstrate the clinical feasibility of MR proton resonance frequency thermometry at 1.5 T with segmented gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequences during liver tumour radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Classical GRE acquisitions and segmented GRE-EPI acquisitions were performed at 1.5 T during simultaneous RF heating with an MR-compatible RF electrode placed in an agar gel phantom. Temperature increments were calculated and compared with four optical temperature probe measurements using Bland- Altman analysis. In a preliminary clinical feasibility study, the rapid GRE-EPI sequence (echo train length=13) was used for MR temperature monitoring of RF ablation of liver tumours in three patient procedures. For phantom experiments, the Bland-Altman mean of differences between MR and optical probe temperature measurements was <0.4DGC, and the 95% limits of agreement value was <1.4DGC. For the in vivo studies, respiratory-triggered GRE-EPI acquisitions yielded a temperature accuracy of 1.3-0.4DGC (acquisition time=0.6s/image, spatial coverage of three slices/respiratory cycle). MR proton resonance frequency thermometry at 1.5 T yields precise and accurate measurements of temperature increment with both classical GRE and rapid GRE-EPI sequences. Rapid GRE-EPI sequences minimize intra-scan motion effects and can be used for MR thermometry during RF ablation in moving organs.},

abstract={PURPOSETo evaluate the combined use of transcatheter intraarterial perfusion (TRIP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging to determine complete tumor targeting during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) when performed within an integrated MR imaging-interventional radiology (IR) angiography suite.MATERIALS AND METHODSBetween October 2006 and March 2007, eight consecutive patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) successfully underwent TACE in a combined MR imaging-IR suite. All patients were male, with a mean age of 59 years (range, 41-71 years). Tumor enhancement on TRIP MR images before and after TACE were qualitatively compared with dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images obtained after TACE. The authors computed the prevalence of perfusion mismatch. The presence of a perfusion mismatch was judged in a binary fashion.RESULTSA perfusion match, confirming complete tumor targeting, occurred in six of the eight patients (75%). There was a perfusion mismatch in two patients (25%). Subsequent interrogation showed that the underlying cause of the mismatch was secondary to an unexpected collateral vessel in the first patient and watershed location of the tumor in the second patient.CONCLUSIONSPerforming TACE in an MR imaging-IR suite can facilitate complete tumor targeting. By comparing perfusion images from TRIP and contrast-enhanced MR sequences, the operator gains confidence and can potentially obtain more selective catheter placement during TACE.},

abstract={Rationale and Objectives Conventional tractography based on the 'streamline' method only partially visualizes the pyramidal tract because of fiber crossing with other white matter tracts. Recently a new tractography method based on directional diffusion function (DDF) has been proposed. This method was reported to visualize the pyramidal tract to a larger extent than conventional techniques do. To validate the DDF-based tractography method, we studied the somatotopic organization of the pyramidal tract in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC). Materials and Methods Pyramidal tracts in the intact hemispheres of 14 brain tumor patients were drawn using the directional diffusion function-based tractography method. Each pyramidal tract was divided into four fiber bundles according to the cephalocaudal positions of their termination in the precentral gyrus. The cephalocaudal positions in the precentral gyrus of the four fiber bundles were correlated with their positional relationships in the PLIC along the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes. Results Fiber bundles terminating more caudally in the precentral gyrus were located significantly more anteriorly in the PLIC (r = 0.59, Spearman's correlation coefficient, P < .0001). On the other hand, no significant correlation was shown between the cephalocaudal positions in the precentral gyrus of the four fiber bundles and their relative positions in the PLIC along the mediolateral axis. Conclusions Estimated organization of the fiber bundles of the pyramidal tract in the PLIC was consistent with anatomically known somatotopic organization, which supported the validity of the DDF-based tractography method.},

abstract={French nuclear codes include flaw assessment procedures: the RSE-M Code 'Rules for In-service Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components' and the RCC-MR code 'Design and Construction Rules for Mechanical Components of FBR Nuclear Islands and High Temperature Applications'. Development of analytical methods has been made for the last 10 years in the framework of a collaboration between CEA, EDF and AREVA-NP, and by R&D actions involving CEA and IRSN. These activities have led to a unification of the common methods of the two codes. The calculation of fracture mechanics parameters, in particular the stress intensity factor KI and the J integral, has been widely developed for industrial configurations. All the developments have been integrated in the 2005 edition of RSE-M and in 2007 edition of RCC-MR.

abstract={The purpose of this work was to implement and assess the performance of interventions inside a cylindrical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with an MR-compatible manipulator system and manipulator-driven real-time MR guidance. The interventional system is based on a seven degree-of-freedom MR-compatible manipulator, which offers man-in-the-loop control either with a graphical user interface or with a master/slave device. The position and the orientation of the interventional tool are sent to an MR scanner for a manipulator-driven dynamic update of the imaging plane to track, visualize and guide the motion of an end-effector. Studies on phantoms were performed with a cylindrical 1.5-T scanner using an operator-managed triggered gradient-recalled echo (GRE) or a computer-managed dynamic True Fast Imaging with Steady Precession (TrueFISP). Targets were acquired with an accuracy of 3.2 mm and with an in-plane path orientation of 2.5 degrees relative to the prescribed one. Path planning, including negotiation of obstacles and needle bending, was successfully performed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of TrueFISP was 25.3+/-2.1 when the manipulator was idle and was 18.6+/-2.4 during its operation. The SNR of triggered GRE (acquired only when the manipulator was idle) was 61.3+/-1.8. In conclusion, this study shows the feasibility of performing manually directed interventions inside cylindrical MR scanners with real-time MRI.},

abstract={Simulated deformations and images can act as the gold standard for evaluating various template-based image segmentation and registration algorithms. Traditional deformable simulation methods, such as the use of analytic deformation fields or the displacement of landmarks followed by some form of interpolation, are often unable to construct rich (complex) and/or realistic deformations of anatomical organs. This paper presents new methods aiming to automatically simulate realistic inter- and intra-individual deformations. The paper first describes a statistical approach to capturing inter-individual variability of high-deformation fields from a number of examples (training samples). In this approach, Wavelet-Packet Transform (WPT) of the training deformations and their Jacobians, in conjunction with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial regularization, are used to capture both coarse and fine characteristics of the training deformations in a statistical fashion. Simulated deformations can then be constructed by randomly sampling the resultant statistical distribution in an unconstrained or a landmark-constrained fashion. The paper also describes a model for generating tissue atrophy or growth in order to simulate intra-individual brain deformations. Several sets of simulated deformation fields and respective images are generated, which can be used in the future for systematic and extensive validation studies of automated atlas-based segmentation and deformable registration methods. The code and simulated data are available through our Web site.},

abstract={Many magnetic resonance test-object properties are temperature-dependent, with typical temperature coefficients of approximately 2-3% K(-1). Therefore, to achieve consistent quality assurance measurements to within 1%, test object temperatures should ideally be known to within 0.3 K. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has previously been used to estimate accurately absolute tissue temperature in vivo, based on the linear temperature dependence of the chemical shift difference between water and temperature-stable reference metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate. In this study, this method of 'internal thermometry' in quality assurance test-objects was investigated, and in particular the value of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propane-1-sulfonate (DSS) as a chemical shift reference was demonstrated. The relationship between the DSS-water chemical shift difference (sigma, expressed in ppm) and temperature tau (in K) was shown to be tau = 764.55 (+/-5.05) - 97.72 (+/-1.05) sigma (286 keywords={Gels; 0; Solutions; Index Medicus; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; Gels -- chemistry; Humans; Solutions -- chemistry; Longitudinal Studies; Quality Control; Temperature; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy -- instrumentation; Phantoms, Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy -- methods},

abstract={The Gafchromic XR type R film is a suitable dosimeter to determine the map of the skin dose in patients undergone complex interventional radiological procedures, such as cardiology ones. The need of preventing or locating possible skin injuries due to high doses administered to patients-as recommended by international organizations-wants the introduction in patient dosimetry of a dosimeter easy to handle, with low dependence of the response on energy in the typical radiological range, and extended measurable dose range. XR type R films fulfil all these requirements and moreover may be quickly analyzed by cheap commercial scanners. In order to determine skin-dose values by XR-R, a film calibration curve is required. In this work, validation of the XR-R dosimetry has been performed for the determination of the skin dose: maximum skin-dose values in 14 patients undergone radiofrequency ablation and pacemaker implant procedures have been determined by XR-R calibrated films. A comparison between skin-dose values determined by XR-R films and retrospective ionometric measurements has pointed out some discrepancies in the results, due to difficulties in retrospectively reproducing the real procedure settings, where XR-R film dosimetry is related to the specific patient procedure, even, in very complex interventional settings.},

abstract={Our goal was to determine the value of echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging in detecting the presence of primary acquired and residual cholesteatoma. One hundred patients were evaluated by preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The patient population consisted of a first group of 55 patients evaluated in order to detect the presence of a primary acquired cholesteatoma. In the second group, 45 patients were evaluated for the presence of a residual cholesteatoma 8-18 months after cholesteatoma surgery, prior to second-look surgery. Surgical findings were compared with preoperative findings on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of both groups was assessed. In the group of primary surgery patients, hyperintense signal compatible with cholesteatoma was found in 89% of cases with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for DWI of 81, 100, 100 and 40%, respectively. In the group of second-look surgery patients, only one of seven surgically verified residual cases was correctly diagnosed using DWI, with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 12.5, 100, 100 and 72%, respectively. These results confirm the value of DWI in detecting primary cholesteatoma, but show the poor capability of DWI in detecting small residual cholesteatoma.},

abstract={The magnetorheological (MR) shock absorber is one of the most promising new devices for vibration reduction. Many investigations have been carried out on low velocity and frequency applications of MR devices. The use of the MR shock absorber under impact load is of great interest. The now widely used MR damper models, such as the Bingham model, cannot explain sufficiently the shear thinning behavior under impact loads. However, the HerschelaBulkley model can be used to explain the same. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the behavior of the MR shock absorber under impact load and to verify the analytical conclusions and experiments. First, some dynamic simulations on the MR shock absorber under impact loads in Matlab and Simulink are carried out. The model describes the dynamic characteristics especially the shear thinning behavior of the shock absorber, based on this model, then analyzes the variations of piston acceleration and back cavity pressure of MR shock absorber at both same and different flow indices. A test rig is developed to test the characteristics of the long-stroke MR shock absorber under impact loads. Comparisons between the simulation and the test results are made to validate our conclusions. The results indicate that the peak acceleration value of the piston rod and the pressure of the back cavity are decided by the peak value and the duration of the impact force. The peak value of the acceleration and the cavity pressure cannot be changed, but the transitional time of the acceleration of the piston and the pressure of the back cavity of MR shock absorber can be controlled by changing the applied current in the electromagnetic coil. MR shock absorbers will be the most promising shock reduction device under an impact environment.},

abstract={A noninvasive NMR technique for evaluating testicular function was explored in this study. Localized in vivo 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on rat testes using a stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence with a short echo time (TE). In the 1H spectra, large lipid signals dominated the chemical shift range of 0.89-2.78 ppm, which prevented the observation of metabolite signals in this region. To suppress these lipid signals, short inversion time (TI) inversion recovery (STIR) was combined with STEAM (STIR-STEAM). The optimal TI was typically 320 ms. STIR-STEAM with a TE of 15 ms allowed successful suppression of the lipid signals and the sensitive detection of several new metabolite signals. In normal testes, choline, creatine, glutamate, and glycine signals were identified. In addition to these metabolites, a lactate signal was observed in ischemic testes. To our knowledge, the signals of glutamate, glycine, and lactate have not been previously assigned in 1H MR spectra of testes in vivo. Lipid suppression by STIR aided in the detection of these metabolites, which would otherwise have been masked by the lipid signals.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEThis study aimed to assess the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the English translation of the original Italian version of the VR-MICS and to evaluate its sensitivity by comparing the coding of English and Italian general practice consultations with emotionally distressed and non-distressed patients, as defined by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).METHODSix male GPs from Manchester (UK) and six from Verona (Italy) each contributed five consultations, which were coded using the VR-MICS. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were assessed both for the division of interviews into speech units and the speech unit coding. Interaction and main effects of GHQ-12 status and nationality on patient and GP expressions were assessed by two-way ANOVA.RESULTSAgreement indices for the division of speech units varied between 88-96 and 87-93% for GP and patient speech, respectively; those for coding categories between 88-91 and 82-86%, with Cohen's Kappa values between 0.86-0.91 and 0.80-0.85 for GP and patient speech, respectively. Cross-cultural comparisons of patient and GP speech showed no interaction effects between GHQ-12 status and nationality. The Italian GPs were more 'doctor-centred', while the UK GPs tended to use a more 'sharing' consulting style. Independent of nationality, distressed patients talked more, gave more psychosocial cues and increased amounts of positive talk compared to non-distressed patients. GPs in both settings, when interviewing distressed patients, reduced social conversation and increased psychosocial information-giving, checking questions and reassurance.CONCLUSIONThe English translation of the VR-MICS showed satisfactory reliability indices and similar sensitivity to patients' verbal behaviours in relation to their emotional state in the two settings.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONSThe VR-MICS may be an useful coding instrument to support collaborative research on doctor-patient communication between the two countries.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEThe choice of arterial input function (AIF) can have a profound effect on the blood flow maps generated on perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI). Automation of this process could substantially reduce operator dependency, increase consistency, and accelerate PWI analysis. We created an automated AIF identification program (auto-AIF) and validated its performance against conventional manual methods.METHODSWe compared the auto-AIF against manually derived AIFs from multisection PWIs of 22 patients with stroke. Time to peak, curve width, curve height, and voxel location determined with both techniques were compared. The time to maximum of the tissue residue function (Tmax) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were computed on a per-pixel basis for each AIF. Spatial patterns of 528 map pairs were compared by computing Pearson correlation coefficients between maps generated with each method.RESULTSAll auto-AIF-derived PWI map parameters, including bolus peak, width, and height, were consistently superior to manually derived ones. Reproducibility of the auto-AIF-based Tmax maps was excellent (r = 1.0). Paired Tmax maps and CBF maps from both techniques were well correlated (r = 0.82). Time to identify the AIF was significantly shorter with the auto-AIF method than with the manual technique (mean difference, 72 seconds; 95% confidence interval: 54, 89 seconds).CONCLUSIONAn automated program that identifies the AIF is feasible and can create reliably reproducible and accurate Tmax and CBF maps. Automation of this process could reduce PWI analysis time and increase consistency and may allow for more effective use of PWI in the evaluation of acute stroke.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE. Noninvasive in vivo hepatic phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy has recently been shown to provide information about hepatic functional status. We sought to show the correlation of phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy with blood biochemistry and liver biopsy results in pediatric patients after liver transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Eleven pediatric transplant recipients (eight with good graft function, two with chronic hepatitis, and one with acute rejection) and four healthy control subjects were studied with in vivo super(31)P MR spectroscopy. Ratios of phosphomonoesters (PME) to total phosphorus (TP), phosphodiester (PDE) to TP, nucleotide triphosphates (NTP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular acid-base status (pH) were measured. Liver function test (n = 11) and biopsy (n = 3) results were obtained for correlation with spectroscopic findings. RESULTS. The eight patients with good graft function displayed spectral profiles similar to those of the healthy subjects, and no significant difference in the metabolic ratios of these patients compared with the control subjects was detected. Three patients with abnormal liver function and biopsy-proven hepatic complications showed elevated PME/TP ratios when compared with those of both the control subjects and the group with good graft function. CONCLUSION. Phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy is a feasible technique for the noninvasive assessment of host-related complications in pediatric patients after liver transplantation. Our preliminary data suggest that the technique may be integrated with MRI for the investigation of impaired liver function in transplant recipients when neither a biliary complication nor a vascular complication is identified.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with stages II-IV squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation therapy or chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 20) or with total laryngectomy (n = 9) were enrolled. Ten patients had oropharyngeal, 13 had laryngeal, and six had hypopharyngeal tumors.

GTVs obtained with the three modalities were compared quantitatively and qualitatively. If patients underwent total laryngectomy, images were validated with the surgical specimen after three-dimensional coregistration. The effect of each modality was estimated with linear mixed-effects models. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made with the Bonferonni or Sidak method. RESULTS: For oropharyngeal tumors and for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal tumors, no significant difference (P > .99) was observed between average GTVs delineated at CT (32.0 and 21.4 cm super(3), respectively) or MR imaging (27.9 and 21.4 cm super(3), respectively), whereas average GTVs at PET were smaller (20.3 P < .10] and 16.4 cm super(3) P < .01], respectively). GTVs from surgical specimens were significantly smaller (12.6 cm super(3), P < .06). In nine patients for whom a surgical specimen was available, no modality adequately depicted superficial tumor extension; this was due to limitations in spatial resolution. In addition, false-positive results were seen for cartilage, extralaryngeal, and preepiglottic extensions. CONCLUSION: Compared with GTVs at CT and MR imaging, GTVs at FDG PET were smaller. In nine patients for whom a surgical specimen was available, PET was found to be the most accurate modality. However, no modality managed to depict superficial tumor extension.},

abstract={Vessel-wall measurements from multicontrast MRI provide information on plaque structure and evolution. This requires the extraction of numerous contours. In this work a contour-extraction method is proposed that uses an active contour model (NLSnake) adapted for a wide range of MR vascular images. This new method employs length normalization for the purpose of deformation computation and offers the advantages of simplified parameter tuning, fast convergence, and minimal user interaction. The model can be initialized far from the boundaries of the region to be segmented, even by only one pixel. The accuracy and reproducibility of NLSnake endoluminal contours were assessed on vascular phantom MR angiography (MRA) and high-resolution in vitro MR images of rabbit aorta. An in vivo evaluation was performed on rabbit and clinical data for both internal and external vessel-wall contours. In phantoms with 95% stenoses, NLSnake measured 94.3% +/- 3.8%, and the accuracy was even better for milder stenoses. In the images of rabbit aorta, variability between NLSnake and experts was less than interobserver variability, while the maximum intravariability of NLSnake was equal to 1.25%. In conclusion, the NLSnake technique successfully quantified the vessel lumen in multicontrast MR images using constant parameters.},

abstract={MRI-based measures of cartilage morphology are being increasingly used as surrogate markers in osteoarthritis. In contrast to other knee joint surfaces, quantitative analysis of the femoral condyles from sagittal MRI suffers from limited precision. The objective, therefore, was to develop a technique for reproducible assessment of femoral cartilage morphology from coronal image data. Coronal MR images (3D T sub(1)-w FLASHwe) of the knee were obtained in 16 healthy volunteers and in 7 patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA, prior to knee arthroplasty), with repositioning between repeated scans. After segmentation the cartilage volume, thickness, and joint surface areas were quantified in the tibia and in an anatomically defined region of the femoral condyle. Immediate test-retest interscan precision errors (CV%) for femoral cartilage volume were 3.0% (SD = 26 mu l) and 3.2% (29 mu l) medially and laterally in volunteers, and 3.0% (34 mu l) and 7.0% (37 mu l) in OA patients. The estimated loss, from cross sectional data, in the patients in the medial femoral condyle (-61%/-4.4 SD) was higher than that in the medial tibia (-45%/-3.1 SD) and compared favorably with precision errors (ratio > 16:1). The technique proposed overcomes some of the problems associated with sagittal scans and thus shows high promise for reliable assessment of femoro-tibial cartilage loss in OA.},

abstract={To assess the impact of the accelerated dynamic MR imaging (ADMRI) approach using parallel imaging for detecting hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and to evaluate the usefulness of a test bolus in examination and subtraction imaging in this setting. Thirty patients with 135 HCCs underwent ADMRI using a two-dimensional gradient-recalled echo sequence with parallel imaging. Seventeen patients were evaluated without a test bolus and 13 patients with a test bolus. The detectability of HCCs was calculated between the groups with and without a test bolus. ADMRI was evaluated regarding the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the lesion and the liver, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the lesion vs. the liver, and the feasibility of subtraction images. ADMRI with and without a test bolus had almost equal sensitivity (92.5% and 92.6%). No significant difference was seen in the SNR of lesions and the CNR of lesions vs. livers between both groups. With a test bolus, ADMRI could depict the peak enhancement of nodules on the 2nd or 3rd dynamic phases and optimized the timing of peak lesion enhancement. Subtraction images could be obtained regarding minimal slice misregistration. ADMRI had high detectability of HCCs with and without a test bolus.},

abstract={PURPOSEInterventional magnetic resonance (MR)-guided transcatheter embolization could potentially limit radiation exposure and improve visualization of target organs. The feasibility of monitoring injection and distribution of embolic agents was assessed in a dynamic flow model with real-time MR imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODSMR-compatible flow models were constructed with use of clear plastic chambers containing 170-microm polyethylene tubular filters. Gadolinium (Gd)-impregnated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles (355-500 and 500-710 microm in size) and Gd-impregnated microspheres (Embospheres, 300-500 and 500-700 microm in size) were injected into the flow circuit under real-time dynamic T1-weighted fast field echo guidance at four images per second. A dynamic steady-state free precession sequence at four images per second was used to monitor the injection of unmodified Embo-Gold 700-900- microm particles. High-resolution scans were obtained before and after each particle injection.RESULTSMR signal enhancement on the dynamic T1-weighted fast field echo sequence was visible during the injection of Gd-impregnated microspheres. Gd-impregnated PVA particles were not detected by this sequence. After injection, microsphere and PVA localization to the filter chambers was confirmed by the high-resolution scans. On the high-resolution sequences, relative MR signal enhancement of the microspheres was higher than that of the PVA particles. The Embo-Gold particles were minimally detectable on the dynamic sequence and undetectable by the high-resolution scan. After particle injection, direct inspection of the filter chamber showed trapping of all particle types and sizes.CONCLUSIONReal-time MR tracking of Gd-impregnated embolic agents is possible in vitro.},

abstract={PURPOSEThis in vitro study investigated the feasibility to visualize the placement of three different atrial septal occluder systems using real-time MR control.METHODSThe experiments were performed on an interventional 1.5 T high field whole body system. Real-time MR imaging was achieved by radial or spiral k-space filling in conjunction with the sliding window reconstruction technique yielding an imaging speed of 15 frames per second. The CardioSeal, Amplatzer Septal Occluder and a specially designed MR-compatible closure device were tested in a water bath. A punctured plastic wall served as model for the atrial septal defect.RESULTSThe delivery systems of the CardioSeal and Amplatzer Occluder were ferromagnetic and caused substantial artifacts, making the device placement impossible, even if the magnetic forces would have been acceptable. The self-made prototype caused only minor susceptibility artifacts allowing its visualization on the MR images. The MR imaging techniques applied enabled real-time control of the occluder including steering through the artificial septal foramen and visualization of the occluder deployment.CONCLUSIONReal-time MR imaging allows for guidance and placement of an MR-compatible septal occluder in vitro suggesting the feasibility to perform atrial septal occlusion under MR-guidance in vivo as well.},

abstract={Expression of androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ER-beta) in the testis of the marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus marmoratus) was investigated, with special attention to changes during the annual testicular cycle, using light microscopy immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Primordial germ cells, primary and secondary spermatogonia and spermatocytes showed a positive reaction to the 3 receptor antibodies during the annual reproductive cycle. Follicular cells were positive to AR, ER-alpha and ER-beta during the spermiogenesis and quiescence periods in the glandular tissue. Interstitial cells showed reactivity to AR, ER-alpha and ER-beta in the spermiogenesis and the quiescence periods, and presented no labelling to these receptors in the proliferative period. These findings suggest that, as in mammals, there is an androgen-estrogen regulation of the function and development of the newt testis.},

abstract={The goal of this research was to develop an automated algorithm for tracking the borders of the left ventricle (LV) in a cine-MRI gradient-echo temporal data set. The algorithm was validated on four patient populations: healthy volunteers and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or left ventricular aneurysm (LVA). A full tomographic set (approximately 11 slices/case) of short-axis images through systole was obtained for each patient. Initial endocardial and epicardial contours for the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) frames were manually traced on the computer by an experienced radiologist. The ED tracings were used as the starting point for the algorithm. The borders were tracked through each phase of the temporal data set, until the ES frame was reached (approximately 7 phases/slice). Peak gradients along equally spaced chords calculated perpendicular to a centerline determined midway between the endocardial and epicardial borders were used for border detection. This approach was tested by comparing the LV epicardial and endocardial volumes calculated at ES to those based on the manual tracings. The results of the algorithm compared favorably with both the endocardial (r2 = 0.72 - 0.98) and epicardial (r2 = 0.96 - 0.99) volumes of the tracer.},

abstract={RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVESThe authors tested whether noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) oximetry is accurate in the in vivo measurement of oxygen saturation in a stroma-free, hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC).MATERIALS AND METHODSA central venous catheter was placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) of 10 New Zealand white rabbits (weight range, 2.5-3.2 kg). Each rabbit underwent removal of 20% of blood volume followed by resuscitation with 10 mL/kg of bovine HBOC-200. Oxygen saturation of the blood mixture was measured in vivo at the IVC with MR oximetry, with separate in vitro calibration for each animal. Blood drawn from the IVC was measured with ex vivo oximetry, which was used as the standard of reference. The in vivo and ex vivo measurements were compared.RESULTSThere was no significant difference (P > .1) between measurements obtained with MR oximetry and ex vivo oximetry. The results with in vivo MR oximetry demonstrated excellent correlation with those from ex vivo oximetry (r = 0.99) over a wide range of physiologic oxygen saturation values (16.7%-74.9%) in venous blood.CONCLUSIONNoninvasive in vivo MR measurement of oxygen saturation is valid for whole blood mixed with stroma-free hemoglobin. Therefore, MR oximetry may be clinically useful for assessing the oxygenation status in patients resuscitated with a HBOC.},

abstract={UNLABELLEDOBJECTIVE; This study evaluated the adjunctive value of gadolinium-infusion MR venography to locate the impalpable testis.SUBJECTS AND METHODSRoutine MR imaging and MR venography were performed in 34 patients presenting with impalpable testis. MR venography was performed by dynamic injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine bismethylamide with images taken at delayed venous phases. The site of the testis was determined by detection of the contrast-enhanced pampiniform venous plexus.RESULTSA total of 44 impalpable testes were examined. Twenty-six hypoplastic canalicular testes, two testes at pelvic skinfold, four atrophic testes in the scrotum, and five intraabdominal testes were detected on both routine MR imaging and MR venography. Five "vanishing" testes in the scrotum and two at the groin region were detected by MR venography but not on MR imaging.CONCLUSIONGadolinium-infusion MR venography is superior to MR imaging in the detection of atrophic testes. The method is a useful adjunct in patients with negative MR imaging findings.},

abstract={RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVESTo determine the extent to which visualization of intrastent anatomy in stents of different composition and design is possible by using contrast-enhanced MR angiography.METHODSTwenty-two MR-compatible stents, most of which had a diameter of 8 mm, were positioned in a phantom filled with aqueous gadolinium solution. Coronal and axial spoiled three-dimensional gradient-echo sequences were performed. Images were acquired with stents positioned at varying angulations to the main magnetic field B0. Profiles orthogonal to the stent axis allowed measurement of artifact sizes independent of window width and center.RESULTSOriented along B0, the Cragg, Corvita, Passager, Wallstent, Strecker, Impag, Perflex, and ZA stents allowed visualization of more than 48% of the lumen. The Memotherm, Smart, and Jostent SelfX stents showed a prominent reduction of the inner lumen to below 41%. The lumina of the covered Jostent, Palmaz, Sinus, and Symphony stents were completely obscured. The Impag, Perflex, and Strecker tantalum stents showed growing artifact sizes and a lumen reduction of at least 40% with increasing angulation to B0. CONCLUSIONS. Evaluation of the inner stent lumen by applying contrast-enhanced, three-dimensional gradient-echo sequences is not possible for the majority of stents because of their large artifacts. These depend on the stent type and orientation to B0. Even stents made of nitinol and cobalt alloys only allow qualitative patency assessment but no quantification of stenosis.},

We derive the posterior distribution of the autocorrelation and the posterior odds ratio for unit roots hypothesis in the AR(1) model when the first four cumulants of the Edgeworth series distribution are finite and the higher order cumulants are negligible.

abstract={A linear magnetorheological (MR) damper, supplied by Lord Corporation, was tested and modeled. Under dynamic conditions, the effects of displacement amplitude, frequency, and magnetic fields on the mechanical properties of MR damper, such as damping force, equivalent-damping capability, were experimentally studied with an INSTRON test machine. A viscoelastic-plastic model is proposed to model the MR behavior. It is shown that the damper response can be satisfactorily predicted with this model. (Author)},
