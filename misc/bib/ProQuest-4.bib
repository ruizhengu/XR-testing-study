abstract={BackgroundGiven that changes in brain water content are often correlated with disease, investigating water content non‐invasively and in vivo could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of several neurologic diseases.PurposeTo adapt a super‐resolution‐based technique, previously developed for humans, to the rat brain and report in vivo high‐resolution (HR) water content maps in comparison with ex vivo wet/dry methods.Study TypeProspective.Animal ModelEight healthy male Wistar rats.Field Strength/Sequence9.4‐T, multi‐echo gradient‐echo (mGRE) sequence.AssessmentUsing super‐resolution reconstruction (SRR), a HR mGRE image (200 μm isotropic) was reconstructed from three low‐resolution (LR) orthogonal whole‐brain images in each animal, which was followed by water content mapping in vivo. The animals were subsequently sacrificed, the brains excised and divided into five regions (front left, front right, middle left, middle right, and cerebellum–brainstem regions), and the water content was measured ex vivo using wet/dry measurements as the reference standard. The water content values of the in vivo and ex vivo methods were then compared for the whole brain and also for the different regions separately.Statistical TestsFriedman's non‐parametric test was used to test difference between the five regions, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for correlation between in vivo and ex vivo measurements. A P‐value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsWater content values derived from in vivo MR measurements showed strong correlations with water content measured ex vivo at a regional level (r = 0.902). Different brain regions showed significantly different water content values. Water content values were highest in the frontal brain, followed by the midbrain, and lowest in the cerebellum and brainstem regions.Data ConclusionAn in vivo technique to achieve HR isotropic water content maps in the rat brain using SRR was adopted in this study. The MRI‐derived water content values obtained using the technique showed strong correlations with water content values obtained using ex vivo wet/dry methods.Level of Evidence1Technical EfficacyStage 1},

abstract={The drying-free preparation of coated magnetic particles has been proven to significantly improve the comprehensive performance and preparation efficiency of magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Due to the magnetic separation technique in the drying-free process, the residual anhydrous ethanol and silicone oil form a Pickering emulsion, whose influence on the properties of MR fluid is ignored in existing mechanical models. In this study, in order to improve the application accuracy of MR fluid and provide methods for further improvement of MR fluid performance, with consideration of the influence of the Pickering emulsion caused by the drying-free process, the tight simple cubic (TSC) structure model and the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure model of MR fluid were proposed based on the mechanism of chain formation of MR fluid and the magnetic dipole theory. To reflect the coexistence and transformation mechanism of these two structures, a distribution probability function was introduced and a hybrid spatial structure model comprised of both TSC and BCC structures was established. The validity and accuracy of the models were verified by the comparison with the experimental data. The proposed hybrid spatial structure micromechanical model considers the influence of Pickering emulsion on the microstructure of MR fluid and can accurately describe the properties of MR fluid prepared by the drying-free process.},

abstract={This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt and validate the Arabic version of the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD) with Saudi Arabian participants. The study encompassed four distinct stages: (i) translation and subsequent back-translation; (ii) a preliminary assessment aimed at evaluating the quality of the translated scale; (iii) an assessment of the reliability of the measures employed; and (iv) a comprehensive examination of the validity of the measures. A sample of Saudi Arabian participants with physical disabilities (N = 206) took part, ranging in age from 18 to 70 years old, with an average age of 39.56 years and a standard deviation of 12.16. The findings obtained from the reliability tests indicated a notable level of internal consistency and stability. Experts and confirmatory factor analysis were employed to establish the face, content, and construct validity. The findings of the assessment of the Arabic version of PASIPD demonstrated a satisfactory degree of reliability and validity, rendering it suitable for implementation within the Saudi Arabian setting.},

abstract={Background and AimsDiagnosis of metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatohepatitis (MASH) requires histology. In this study, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) score was developed and validated to identify MASH in patients with metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Secondarily, a screening strategy for MASH diagnosis was investigated.MethodsThis prospective multicentre study included 317 patients with biopsy‐proven MASLD and contemporaneous MRI. The discovery cohort (Spain, Portugal) included 194 patients. NAFLD activity score (NAS) and fibrosis were assessed with the NASH‐CRN histologic system. MASH was defined by the presence of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning, with NAS ≥4 with or without fibrosis. An MRI‐based composite biomarker of Proton Density Fat Fraction and waist circumference (MR–MASH score) was developed. Findings were afterwards validated in an independent cohort (United States, Spain) with different MRI protocols.ResultsIn the derivation cohort, 51% (n = 99) had MASH. The MR–MASH score identified MASH with an AUC = .88 (95% CI .83–.93) and strongly correlated with NAS (r = .69). The MRI score lower cut‐off corresponded to 88% sensitivity with 86% NPV, while the upper cut‐off corresponded to 92% specificity with 87% PPV. MR–MASH was validated with an AUC = .86 (95% CI .77–.92), 91% sensitivity (lower cut‐off) and 87% specificity (upper cut‐off). A two‐step screening strategy with sequential MR–MASH examination performed in patients with indeterminate‐high FIB‐4 or transient elastography showed an 83–84% PPV to identify MASH. The AUC of MR–MASH was significantly higher than that of the FAST score (p < .001).ConclusionsThe MR–MASH score has clinical utility in the identification and management of patients with MASH at risk of progression.},

abstract={One limitation on the ability to monitor health in older adults using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the presence of implants, where the prevalence of implantable devices (orthopedic, cardiac, neuromodulation) increases in the population, as does the pervasiveness of conditions requiring MRI studies for diagnosis (musculoskeletal diseases, infections, or cancer). The present study describes a novel multiphysics implant modeling testbed using the following approaches with two examples: (1) an in silico human model based on the widely available Visible Human Project (VHP) cryo-section dataset; (2) a finite element method (FEM) modeling software workbench from Ansys (Electronics Desktop/Mechanical) to model MR radio frequency (RF) coils and the temperature rise modeling in heterogeneous media. The in silico VHP-Female model (250 parts with an additional 40 components specifically characterizing embedded implants and resultant surrounding tissues) corresponds to a 60-year-old female with a body mass index of 36. The testbed includes the FEM-compatible in silico human model, an implant embedding procedure, a generic parameterizable MRI RF birdcage two-port coil model, a workflow for computing heat sources on the implant surface and in adjacent tissues, and a thermal FEM solver directly linked to the MR coil simulator to determine implant heating based on an MR imaging study protocol. The primary target is MR labeling of large orthopedic implants. The testbed has very recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device development tool for 1.5 T orthopedic implant examinations.},

abstract={In multicenter MRI studies, pooling the imaging data can introduce site-related variabilities and can therefore bias the subsequent analyses. To harmonize the intensity distributions of brain MR images in a multicenter dataset, unsupervised deep learning methods can be employed. Here, we developed a model based on cycle-consistent adversarial networks for the harmonization of T1-weighted brain MR images. In contrast to previous works, it was designed to process three-dimensional whole-brain images in a stable manner while optimizing computation resources. Using six different MRI datasets for healthy adults (n=1525 in total) with different acquisition parameters, we tested the model in (i) three pairwise harmonizations with site effects of various sizes, (ii) an overall harmonization of the six datasets with different age distributions, and (iii) a traveling-subject dataset. Our results for intensity distributions, brain volumes, image quality metrics and radiomic features indicated that the MRI characteristics at the various sites had been effectively homogenized. Next, brain age prediction experiments and the observed correlation between the gray-matter volume and age showed that thanks to an appropriate training strategy and despite biological differences between the dataset populations, the model reinforced biological patterns. Furthermore, radiologic analyses of the harmonized images attested to the conservation of the radiologic information in the original images. The robustness of the harmonization model (as judged with various datasets and metrics) demonstrates its potential for application in retrospective multicenter studies.},

abstract={BackgroundNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. To avoid limitations of liver biopsy and MRI, quantitative ultrasound has become a research focus. Ultrasound-derived fat fraction (UDFF) is based on a combination of backscatter coefficient and attenuation parameter.ObjectiveThe objectives of the study were to determine (1) agreement between UDFF/MRI proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF) and (2) whether BMI and age are predictive for UDFF.Materials and methodsThis cross-sectional prospective study included a convenience sample of 46 children referred for clinically indicated abdominal MRI. MR-PDFF and five acquisitions of UDFF were collected. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to assess agreement between MR-PDFF and UDFF. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for UDFF prediction of liver steatosis (MR-PDFF ≥ 6%). Multivariable regression was performed to assess BMI and age as predictors for UDFF.ResultsTwenty-two participants were male, 24 were female, and the mean age was 14 ± 3 (range: 7-18) years. Thirty-six out of 46 participants had normal liver fat fraction <6%, and 10/46 had liver steatosis. UDFF was positively associated with MR-PDFF (ICC 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96). The mean bias between UDFF and MR-PDFF was 0.64% (95% LOA, -5.3-6.6%). AUROC of UDFF for steatosis was of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-0.99). UDFF cutoff of 6% had a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI, 55-99%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI, 81-0.99%). BMI was an independent predictor of UDFF (correlation: 0.55 (95% CI, 0.35-0.95)).ConclusionsUDFF shows strong agreement with MR-PDFF in children. A UDFF cutoff of 6% provides good sensitivity and specificity for detection of MR-PDFF of ≥ 6%.},

abstract={BackgroundGenetic testing for molecular markers of gliomas sometimes is unavailable because of time‐consuming and expensive, even limited tumor specimens or nonsurgery cases.PurposeTo train a three‐class radiomic model classifying three molecular subtypes including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and 1p/19q‐noncodeleted (IDHmut‐noncodel), IDH wild‐type (IDHwt), IDH‐mutant and 1p/19q‐codeleted (IDHmut‐codel) of adult gliomas and investigate whether radiomic features from diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) could bring additive value.Study TypeRetrospective.PopulationA total of 755 patients including 111 IDHmut‐noncodel, 571 IDHwt, and 73 IDHmut‐codel cases were divided into training (n = 480) and internal validation set (n = 275); 139 patients including 21 IDHmut‐noncodel, 104 IDHwt, and 14 IDHmut‐codel cases were utilized as external validation set.Field Strength/SequenceA 1.5 T or 3.0 T/multiparametric MRI, including T1‐weighted (T1), T1‐weighted gadolinium contrast‐enhanced (T1c), T2‐weighted (T2), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and DWI.AssessmentThe performance of multiparametric radiomic model (random‐forest model) using 22 selected features from T1, T2, FLAIR, T1c images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and conventional radiomic model using 20 selected features from T1, T2, FLAIR, and T1c images was assessed in internal and external validation sets by comparing probability values and actual incidence.Statistical TestsMann–Whitney U test, Chi‐Squared test, Wilcoxon test, receiver operating curve (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC); DeLong analysis. P < 0.05 was statistically significant.ResultsThe multiparametric radiomic model achieved AUC values for IDHmut‐noncodel, IDHwt, and IDHmut‐codel of 0.8181, 0.8524, and 0.8502 in internal validation set and 0.7571, 0.7779, and 0.7491 in external validation set, respectively. Multiparametric radiomic model showed significantly better diagnostic performance after DeLong analysis, especially in classifying IDHwt and IDHmut‐noncodel subtypes.Data ConclusionRadiomic features from DWI could bring additive value and improve the performance of conventional MRI‐based radiomic model for classifying the molecular subtypes especially IDHmut‐noncodel and IDHwt of adult gliomas.Level of Evidence3.Technical EfficacyStage 2.},

abstract={Radiotherapy treatment planning based only on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become clinically achievable. Though computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for radiotherapy imaging, directly providing the electron density values needed for planning calculations, MRI has superior soft tissue visualisation to guide treatment planning decisions and optimisation. MRI-only planning removes the need for the CT scan, but requires generation of a substitute/synthetic/pseudo CT (sCT) for electron density information. Shortening the MRI imaging time would improve patient comfort and reduce the likelihood of motion artefacts. A volunteer study was previously carried out to investigate and optimise faster MRI sequences for a hybrid atlas-voxel conversion to sCT for prostate treatment planning. The aim of this follow-on study was to clinically validate the performance of the new optimised sequence for sCT generation in a treated MRI-only prostate patient cohort. 10 patients undergoing MRI-only treatment were scanned on a Siemens Skyra 3T MRI as part of the MRI-only sub-study of the NINJA clinical trial (ACTRN12618001806257). Two sequences were used, the standard 3D T2-weighted SPACE sequence used for sCT conversion which has been previously validated against CT, and a modified fast SPACE sequence, selected based on the volunteer study. Both were used to generate sCT scans. These were then compared to evaluate the fast sequence conversion for anatomical and dosimetric accuracy against the clinically approved treatment plans. The average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the body was 14.98 ± 2.35 HU, and for bone was 40.77 ± 5.51 HU. The external volume contour comparison produced a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of at least 0.976, and an average of 0.985 ± 0.004, and the bony anatomy contour comparison a DSC of at least 0.907, and an average of 0.950 ± 0.018. The fast SPACE sCT agreed with the gold standard sCT within an isocentre dose of -0.28% ± 0.16% and an average gamma pass rate of 99.66% ± 0.41% for a 1%/1 mm gamma tolerance. In this clinical validation study, the fast sequence, which reduced the required imaging time by approximately a factor of 4, produced an sCT with similar clinical dosimetric results compared to the standard sCT, demonstrating its potential for clinical use for treatment planning.},

abstract={The latest technological advancements in the domain of virtual reality (VR) have created new opportunities to use VR as a training platform for medical students and practitioners more broadly. Despite the growing interest in the use of VR as a training tool, a commonly identified gap in VR-training for medical education is the confidence in the long-term validity of the applications. A systematic literature review was undertaken to explore the extent of VR (in particular head-mounted displays) applications for medical training with an additional focus on validation measures. The papers included in this review discussed empirical case studies of specific applications; however, these were mostly concerned with human-computer interaction and were polarized between demonstrating that a conceptual technology solution was feasible for simulation or looked at specific areas of VR usability with little discussion on validation measures for long-term training effectiveness and outcomes. The review uncovered a wide range of ad hoc applications and studies in terms of technology vendors, environments, tasks, envisaged users and effectiveness of learning outcomes. This presents decision-making challenges for those seeking to adopt, implement and embed such systems in teaching practice. The authors of this paper then take a wider socio-technical systems perspective to understand how the holistic training system can be engineered and validated effectively as fit for purpose, through distillation of a generic set of requirements from the literature review to aid design specification and implementation, and to drive more informed and traceable validation of these types of systems. In this review, we have identified 92 requirement statements in 11 key areas against which a VR-HMD training system could be validated; these were grouped into design considerations, learning mechanisms and implementation considerations.},

abstract={IntroductionResearchers have highlighted concerns regarding the limited diagnostic utility and ecological validity of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Recent advancements in VR-based CPTs have attempted to address these concerns by simulating real-life scenarios and enhancing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis; however, certain areas require improvement for obtaining reliable data from both healthy individuals and those with ADHD. To tackle these issues, we developed an enhanced VR-based CPT program featuring four distinct difficulty levels, advancing toward home-based assessment.MethodOur feasibility study involved subjects without ADHD to establish a normative profile for VR-based CPT before extending it to ADHD assessment. Our sample included 20 Korean adults. They received a VR device with the VR-based CPT program installed and were asked to perform 1-2 blocks per day at home. Participants were instructed to complete 12 blocks over the subsequent 2 weeks. Psychological assessments and electroencephalograms (EEGs) were administered before and after the program. Post-study usability measures were also collected.ResultHigher commission errors were notably evident in the "very high" difficulty level which featured complex stimuli and increased distraction. A notable correlation emerged between the overall distraction level and CPT accuracy, along with a significant link between intensity scores and commission errors. No significant differences were found in psychological assessment and there were no significant changes in the Theta-Beta Ratio (TBR) index before and after the program. The usability of our program was fair.DiscussionThe study reveals that the newly designed VR-CPT program, simulating diverse real-life environments and offering varying task difficulty levels, proved acceptable and feasible. The key point of our study was that the adjustment and segmentation of difficulty levels in the VR-based CPT were achieved, and that this effort was validated by examining the impact of different levels of difficulty on CPT measures. Implementing this experimental setup in a home-based environment increased ecological validity, as well as clinical utility. Limitations and suggested directions for further investigation are described in detail.},

abstract={BackgroundVisuospatial memory impairment is a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease; however, conventional visuospatial memory tests are insufficient to fully reflect visuospatial memory impairment in daily life.MethodsTo address patients' difficulties in locating and recalling misplaced objects, we introduced a novel visuospatial memory test, the Hidden Objects Test (HOT), conducted in a virtual environment. We categorized HOT scores into prospective memory, item free-recall, place free-recall, item recognition, and place-item matching scores. To validate the VR memory test, we compared HOT scores among individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and normal controls (NC), and also compared these scores with those of conventional neuropsychological tests. We tracked the participants' movement paths in the virtual environment and assessed basic features, such as total distance, duration, and speed. Additionally, we performed walking trajectory pattern mining such as outlier and stay-point detection.ResultsWe designed and implemented the HOT to simulate a house's living room and assess participants' ability to locate hidden objects. Our preliminary results showed that the total HOT score differed among 17 patients with AD, 14 with aMCI, and 15 NC (p < 0.001). The total HOT score correlated positively with conventional memory test scores (p < 0.001). Walking trajectories showed that patients with AD and aMCI wandered rather than going straight to the hidden objects. In terms of basic features, the total duration was significantly greater in AD than in NC (p = 0.008). In terms of trajectory pattern mining, the number of outliers, which were over 95% of the estimated trajectory, was significantly higher in AD than in NC (p = 0.002). The number of stay points, an index in which participants stayed in the same position for more than 2 s, was significantly higher in patients with AD and aMCI compared with NC (AD vs. NC: p = 0.003, aMCI vs. NC: p = 0.019).ConclusionThe HOT simulating real life showed potential as an ecologically valid test for assessing visuospatial memory function in daily life. Walking trajectory analysis suggested that patients with AD and aMCI wandered rather than going straight toward the hidden objects.},

abstract={A great deal of economic problems are related to detecting the stability of time series data, where the main interest is in the unit root test. In this paper, we consider the unit root testing problem with errors being long-memory processes with the GARCH structure. A new test statistic is developed by using the random weighted bootstrap method. It turns out that the proposed statistic has a chi-squared distribution asymptotically regardless of the process being stationary or nonstationary, and with or without an intercept term. The simulation results show that the statistic has a desired finite sample performance in terms of both size and power. A real data application is also given relying on the inflation rate data of 17 countries.},

abstract={The Min Jiang Testing Reactor (MJTR) is a new irradiation facility for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. In this study, we systematically evaluated the neutron flux field gradients of the MJTR for irradiation of samples for 40Ar/39Ar dating and yielded an average neutron flux equivalence of 0.21 × 10−4J h−1 over the neutron irradiation process. The vertical and the horizontal gradients are down to 0.68% cm−1 and 0.45% cm−1, respectively, indicating a sufficiently wide neutron flux stabilization field for 40Ar/39Ar sample irradiation. The production rate ratios of interfering reactions are (36Ar/37Ar)Ca: 4.17 ± 0.07 × 10−4, (39Ar/37Ar)Ca: 18.4 ± 3.6 × 10−4, and (40Ar/39Ar)K: 146.5 ± 42.4 × 10−4, within the range of other nuclear reactors worldwide. The J value error can be estimated to be <1‰ (1sd) when the sample is placed close to the irradiation thimble center. Four aliquots of DRA-1 yield a consistent intercalibration factor between ZBH-25 and DRA-1 with an average of 0.183061 ± 0.000432 (1sd, 2.4‰), indicating that the MJTR is suitable for high-precision 40Ar/39Ar sample irradiation.},

abstract={The rapid expansion of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) into various applications has increased the demand for hands-free input interfaces when traditional control methods are inapplicable (e.g., for paralyzed individuals who cannot move their hands). Facial electromyogram (fEMG), bioelectric signals generated from facial muscles, could solve this problem. Discriminating facial gestures using fEMG is possible because fEMG signals vary with these gestures. Thus, these signals can be used to generate discrete hands-free control commands. This study implemented an fEMG-based facial gesture recognition system for generating discrete commands to control an AR or VR environment. The fEMG signals around the eyes were recorded, assuming that the fEMG electrodes were embedded into the VR head-mounted display (HMD). Sixteen discrete facial gestures were classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with Riemannian geometry features. Because the fEMG electrodes were far from the facial muscles associated with the facial gestures, some similar facial gestures were indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, this study determined the best facial gesture combinations with the highest classification accuracy for 3–15 commands. An analysis of the fEMG data acquired from 15 participants showed that the optimal facial gesture combinations increased the accuracy by 4.7%p compared with randomly selected facial gesture combinations. Moreover, this study is the first to investigate the feasibility of implementing a subject-independent facial gesture recognition system that does not require individual user training sessions. Lastly, our online hands-free control system was successfully applied to a media player to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system.},

abstract={The field of spatial cognitive training and evaluation has rapidly evolved. However, the low learning motivation and engagement of the subjects hinder the widespread use of spatial cognitive training. This study designed a home-based spatial cognitive training and evaluation system (SCTES), which aimed to train subjects on spatial cognitive tasks for 20 days, and compared the brain activities before and after the training. This study also evaluated the feasibility of using a portable all-in-one prototype for cognitive training that combined a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display with high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. During the course of training, the length of the navigation path and the distance between the starting position and the platform position revealed significant behavioral differences. In the testing sessions, the subjects showed significant behavioral differences in the time it took to complete the test task before and after training. After only four days of training, the subjects demonstrated significant differences in the Granger causality analysis (GCA) characteristics of brain regions in the Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], and Formula Omitted] frequency bands of the EEG, as well as significant differences in the GCA of the EEG in the Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted], and Formula Omitted] frequency bands between the two test sessions. The proposed SCTES used a compact and all-in-one form factor to train and evaluate spatial cognition and collect EEG signals and behavioral data simultaneously. The recorded EEG data can be used to quantitatively assess the efficacy of spatial training in patients with spatial cognitive impairments.},

abstract={Although medical imaging technology has persisted in evolving over the last decades, the techniques and technologies used for analytical and visualization purposes have remained constant. Manual or semiautomatic segmentation is, in many cases, complicated. It requires the intervention of a specialist and is time-consuming, especially during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has had devastating medical and economic consequences. Processing and visualizing medical images with advanced techniques represent medical professionals’ breakthroughs. This article studies how augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) can transform medical practice during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report an AR visualization and interaction platform; it covers the whole process from uploading chest computed tomography (CT)-scan images to automatic segmentation-based deep learning, 3-D reconstruction, 3-D visualization, and manipulation. AR provides a more realistic 3-D visualization system, allowing doctors to effectively interact with the generated 3-D model of segmented lungs and COVID-19 lesions. We use the U-Net neural network (NN) for automated segmentation. The statistical measures obtained using the Dice score, pixel accuracy, sensitivity, Formula Omitted]-mean, and specificity are 0.749, 0.949, 0.956, 0.955, and 0.954, respectively. The user-friendliness and usability are objectified by a formal user study that compared our AR-assisted design to the standard diagnosis setup. One hundred and six doctors and medical students, including eight senior medical lecturers, volunteered to assess our platform. The platform could be used as an aid-diagnosis tool to identify and analyze the COVID-19 infectious or as a training tool for residents and medical students. The prototype can be extended to other pulmonary pathologies.},

abstract={ObjectivesVirtual reality (VR) offers an ecological setting and the possibility of altered visual feedback during head movements useful for vestibular research and treatment of vestibular disorders. There is however no data quantifying vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during head impulse test (HIT) in VR. The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and performance of eye and head movement measurements of healthy subjects in a VR environment during high velocity horizontal head rotation (VR-HIT) under a normal visual feedback condition. The secondary objective is to establish the feasibility of VR-HIT recordings in the same group of normal subjects but under altered visual feedback conditions.DesignTwelve healthy subjects underwent video HIT using both a standard setup (vHIT) and VR-HIT. In VR, eye and head positions were recorded by using, respectively, an imbedded eye tracker and an infrared motion tracker. Subjects were tested under four conditions, one reproducing normal visual feedback and three simulating an altered gain or direction of visual feedback. During these three altered conditions the movement of the visual scene relative to the head movement was decreased in amplitude by 50% (half), was nullified (freeze) or was inverted in direction (inverse).ResultsEye and head motion recording during normal visual feedback as well as during all 3 altered conditions was successful. There was no significant difference in VOR gain in VR-HIT between normal, half, freeze and inverse conditions. In the normal condition, VOR gain was significantly but slightly (by 3%) different for VR-HIT and vHIT. Duration and amplitude of head impulses were significantly greater in VR-HIT than in vHIT. In all three altered VR-HIT conditions, covert saccades were present in approximatively one out of four trials.ConclusionOur VR setup allowed high quality recording of eye and head data during head impulse test under normal and altered visual feedback conditions. This setup could be used to investigate compensation mechanisms in vestibular hypofunction, to elicit adaptation of VOR in ecological settings or to allow objective evaluation of VR-based vestibular rehabilitation.},

abstract={IntroductionAttentional bias (AB) is considered an important factor not only in the etiology of addiction, but also with respect to relapse. However, evidence for the predictive ability of AB for relapse is not robust. One reason for this might be fluctuations of AB due to stress. Therefore, the current study investigated whether AB was present during and after stress induction and whether AB was enhanced by stress induction.MethodsA Virtual Reality (VR) adaptation of the Trier Social Stress Test (VR-TSST) was used to induce psychosocial stress in smokers (n = 34) and non-smokers (n = 37) followed by a novel free-viewing task in VR. Eye tracking data was recorded to examine gaze behavior to smoking-related and neutral stimuli presented in the VR-TSST and the free-viewing task.ResultsStress ratings increased significantly from baseline to post VR-TSST in smokers and non-smokers. During the VR-TSST we observed, more frequent, longer, and earlier fixations on smoke-related compared with neutral stimuli without significant group differences. However, in the free-viewing task following the stress induction, a specific AB of smokers in terms of earlier and longer fixations on smoke stimuli was found.ConclusionResults indicate that AB is not a persistent trait in smokers, but is context dependent. It is suggested that emotional learning processes such as smoking in the context of relief after stress may contribute to changes of AB both in terms of increased initial attention and deeper stimulus processing. Additionally, the potential of the VR-TSST to induce psychosocial stress could be replicated.},

abstract={In this paper, we present ARCHIE++, a testing framework for conducting AR system testing and collecting user feedback in the wild. Our system addresses challenges in AR testing practices by aggregating usability feedback data (collected in situ ) with system performance data from that same time period. These data packets can then be leveraged to identify edge cases encountered by testers during unconstrained usage scenarios. We begin by presenting a set of current trends in performing human testing of AR systems, identified by reviewing a selection of recent work from leading conferences in mixed reality, human factors, and mobile and pervasive systems. From the trends, we identify a set of challenges to be faced when attempting to adopt these practices to testing in the wild. These challenges are used to inform the design of our framework, which provides a cloud-enabled and device-agnostic way for AR systems developers to improve their knowledge of environmental conditions and to support scalability and reproducibility when testing in the wild. We then present a series of case studies demonstrating how ARCHIE++ can be used to support a range of AR testing scenarios, and demonstrate the limited overhead of the framework through a series of evaluations. We close with additional discussion on the design and utility of ARCHIE++ under various edge conditions.},

abstract={Classroom experiments related to investigating the centripetal force are often underrepresented in the physics teaching practice. This is largely due to the fact that schools lack the proper equipment and teachers lack the time to perform the rather tedious data collection procedures which are characteristic for some of the traditional experimental setups. A possible solution to this problem is to develop and utilize alternative experimental setups within the digital environment. In fact, earlier research has shown that new generations of students are highly motivated to learn physics in digital environments and that these environments often provide at least as efficient learning of concepts as traditional environments. In this article, we present an augmented reality Android application named CEntripetalForceAR (CEFAR) that allows students to experimentally investigate how centripetal force depends on the period of orbital motion and the orbital radius. A possible pedagogical approach to using CEFAR is also described, including suggestions on how CEFAR can be used to overcome some of the most common misconceptions related to circular motion. A user experience survey which included 163 first-year university students showed that CEFAR can be awarded an excellent usability rating. Most students stated that the application helped them to improve their understanding about centripetal force either by visualization or by the possibility to explore cause and effect relationships.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDThe effectiveness of virtual reality exposure (VRE) in the treatment of anxiety disorders is well established. Several psychological mechanisms of VRE have been identified, whereby both emotional processing and the sense of presence play a key role. However, there are only few studies that contribute to our knowledge of examples of implementation in the case of VRE for claustrophobia based on patients' experiences and the perspective of therapists.OBJECTIVEThis study asks for key elements of a VRE app that are necessary for effective exposure for people with claustrophobic symptoms.METHODSA mixed methods design was applied in which patients (n=15) and therapeutic experts (n=15) tested a VRE intervention of an elevator ride at 5 intensity levels. Intensity was varied by elevator size, duration of the elevator ride, and presence of virtual humans. Quantitative measures examined self-reported presence with the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) ranging from 0 to 6 and 15 Likert-scaled evaluation items that had been developed for the purpose of this study, ranging from 1 to 5. In both measures, higher scores indicate higher levels of presence or agreement. Think-aloud protocols of the patients and semistructured interviews posttreatment of all participants were conducted to gain in-depth perspectives on emotional processes.RESULTSThe intervention induced a feeling of presence in patients and experts, posttreatment scores showed a high IPQ presence score (mean 3.84, SD 0.88), with its subscores IPQ spatial presence (mean 4.53, SD 1.06), IPQ involvement (mean 3.83, SD 1.22), and IPQ experienced realism (mean 2.75, SD 1.02). Patients preferred a setting in the presence of a therapist (mean 4.13, SD 0.83) more than the experts did (mean 3.33, SD 1.54). Think-aloud protocols of the patients revealed that presence and anxiety both were achieved. Qualitative interviews of patients and experts uncovered 8 topics: feelings and emotions, personal story, telepresence, potential therapeutic effects, barriers, conditions and requirements, future prospects, and realization. The intensity levels were felt to appropriately increase in challenge, with ambivalent results regarding the final level. Virtual humans contributed to feelings of fear.CONCLUSIONSKey elements of a VRE app for claustrophobic symptoms should include variation of intensity by adding challenging cues in order to evoke presence and anxiety. Virtual humans are a suitable possibility to make the intervention realistic and to provide a sense of closeness; however, some of the fears might then be related to symptoms of social phobia or agoraphobia. Patients may need the physical presence of a therapist, though not all of them share this view. A higher degree of sophistication in the intensity levels is needed to deliver targeted help for specific symptoms of anxiety.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDThe Pica, ARFID, and Rumination Disorder Interview (PARDI) is a structured interview that can be used to determine diagnosis, presenting characteristics, and severity across three disorders, including avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a questionnaire focused specifically on ARFID (PARDI-AR-Q), which has the potential to provide related information with less participant burden.METHODSAdolescents and adults (n = 71, ages 14-40 years) with ARFID (n = 42) and healthy control participants (HC, n = 29) completed the PARDI-AR-Q and other measures. A subset of the ARFID group (n = 27) also completed the PARDI interview.RESULTSAn exploratory factor analysis of proposed subscale items identified three factors corresponding to the ARFID phenotypes of avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food, lack of interest in eating or food, and concern about aversive consequences of eating. Further analyses supported the internal consistency and convergent validity of the PARDI-AR-Q subscales, and subscale ratings on the questionnaire showed large and significant correlations (all p-values < 0.001; r's ranging from 0.48 to 0.77) with the corresponding subscales on the interview. The ARFID group scored significantly higher than HC on all subscales. Furthermore, 90% of the ARFID group scored positive on the PARDI-AR-Q diagnostic algorithm while 93% of the HC scored negative.CONCLUSIONSThough replication in larger and more diverse samples is needed, findings provide early support for the validity of the PARDI-AR-Q as a self-report measure for possible ARFID in clinical or research settings.},

abstract={PURPOSETo report the application of LUXIE and validate its reliability by comparing the test results with those of Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 (HFA3).METHODSIn this pilot study, we prospectively recruited participants who had received HFA3 SITA standard 30-2 perimetry and tested them with LUXIE on the same day. LUXIE is a software designed for visual field testing cooperating with HTC Vive Pro Eye, a head-mounted virtual reality device with an eye-tracking system. The test stimuli were synchronized with eye movements captured by the eye-tracking system to eliminate fixation loss. The global, hemifields, quadrants, glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) sectors, and point-by-point retinal sensitivities were compared between LUXIE and HFA3. All participants were asked to fill out a post-test user survey.RESULTSThirty-eight participants with 65 eyes were enrolled. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3 in global (r = 0.81), superior hemifield (r = 0.77), superonasal, superotemporal, and inferonasal quadrants (r = 0.80, 0.78, 0.80). The user survey showed that participants were more satisfied with LUXIE in operating difficulty, comfortability, time perception, concentration, and overall satisfaction.CONCLUSIONSLUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3. Fixation loss could be eliminated in LUXIE with the eye-tracking system. The application of virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye makes telemedicine and even home-based self-screening visual field tests possible.KEY MESSAGES1. Virtual reality perimetry is a developing technology that has the potential in telemedicine, and home self-screening visual field tests. 2. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 in visual field retinal sensitivities.},

abstract={The value of kinematic data for skill assessment is being investigated. This is the first virtual reality simulator developed for liver surgery. This simulator was coded in C++ using PhysX and FleX with a novel cutting algorithm and used a patient data-derived model and two instruments functioning as ultrasonic shears. The simulator was evaluated by nine expert surgeons and nine surgical novices. Each participant performed a simulated metastasectomy after training. Kinematic data were collected for the instrument position. Each participant completed a survey. The expert participants had a mean age of 47 years and 9/9 were certified in surgery. Novices had a mean age of 30 years and 0/9 were certified surgeons. The mean path length (novice 0.76 ± 0.20 m vs. expert 0.46 ± 0.16 m, p = 0.008), movements (138 ± 45 vs. 84 ± 32, p = 0.043) and time (174 ± 44 s vs. 102 ± 42 s, p = 0.004) were significantly different for the two participant groups. There were no significant differences in activating the instrument (107 ± 25 vs. 109 ± 53). Participants considered the simulator realistic (6.5/7) (face validity), appropriate for education (5/7) (content validity) with an effective interface (6/7), consistent motion (5/7) and realistic soft tissue behavior (5/7). This study showed that the simulator differentiates between experts and novices. Simulation may be an effective way to obtain kinematic data.},

abstract={PurposeDevelop a deflectable intracardiac MR imaging (ICMRI) guiding‐sheath to accelerate imaging during MR‐guided electrophysiological (EP) interventions for radiofrequency (500 kHz) ablation (RFA) of arrythmia. Requirements include imaging at three to five times surface‐coil SNR in cardiac chambers, vascular insertion, steerable‐active‐navigation into cardiac chambers, operation with ablation catheters, and safe levels of MR‐induced heating.MethodsICMRI’s 6 mm outer‐diameter (OD) metallic‐braided shaft had a 2.6 mm OD internal lumen for ablation‐catheter insertion. Miniature‐Baluns (MBaluns) on ICMRI’s 1 m shaft reduced body‐coil‐induced heating. Distal section was a folded “star”‐shaped imaging‐coil mounted on an expandable frame, with an integrated miniature low‐noise‐amplifier overcoming cable losses. A handle‐activated movable‐shaft expanded imaging‐coil to 35 mm OD for imaging within cardiac‐chambers. Four MR‐tracking micro‐coils enabled navigation and motion‐compensation, assuming a tetrahedron‐shape when expanded. A second handle‐lever enabled distal‐tip deflection. ICMRI with a protruding deflectable EP catheter were used for MR‐tracked navigation and RFA using a dedicated 3D‐slicer user‐interface. ICMRI was tested at 3T and 1.5T in swine to evaluate (a) heating, (b) cardiac‐chamber access, (c) imaging field‐of‐view and SNR, and (d) intraprocedural RFA lesion monitoring.ResultsThe 3T and 1.5T imaging SNR demonstrated >400% SNR boost over a 4 × 4 × 4 cm3 FOV in the heart, relative to body and spine arrays. ICMRI with MBaluns met ASTM/IEC heating limits during navigation. Tip‐deflection allowed navigating ICMRI and EP catheter into atria and ventricles. Acute‐lesion long‐inversion‐time‐T1‐weighted 3D‐imaging (TWILITE) ablation‐monitoring using ICMRI required 5:30 min, half the time needed with surface arrays alone.ConclusionICMRI assisted EP‐catheter navigation to difficult targets and accelerated RFA monitoring.},

abstract={ObjectivesTo evaluate whether lung perfusion continues to be reduced in 10-year-old children after congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and whether lung perfusion values correlate with spirometric lung function measurements.MethodsFifty-four patients after CDH repair received dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based lung perfusion measurements at the age of 10 years (10.2 ± 1.0 years). Additionally, a control group of 10 children has been examined according to the same protocol. Lung spirometry was additionally available in 43 patients of the CDH group. A comparison of ipsilateral and contralateral parameters was performed.ResultsPulmonary blood flow (PBF) was reduced on the ipsilateral side in CDH patients (60.4 ± 23.8 vs. 93.3 ± 16.09 mL/100 mL/min; p < 0.0001). In comparison to the control group, especially the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral, PBF was reduced in CDH patients (0.669 ± 0.152 vs. 0.975 ± 0.091; p < 0.0001). There is a positive correlation between ipsilateral pulmonary blood flow, and spirometric forced 1-s volume (r = 0.45; p = 0.0024).ConclusionsPulmonary blood flow impairment persists during childhood and correlates with spirometric measurements. Without the need for ionizing radiation, MRI measurements seem promising as follow-up parameters after CDH.Key Points• Ten-year-old children after congenital diaphragmatic hernia continue to show reduced perfusion of ipsilateral lung.• Lung perfusion values correlate with lung function tests after congenital diaphragmatic hernia.},

abstract={Online magnetic resonance (MR)‐guided radiotherapy is expected to benefit brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) due to superior soft tissue contrast and capability of daily adaptive planning. The purpose of this study was to investigate daily adaptive plan quality with setup variations and to perform an end‐to‐end test for brain SRS with multiple metastases treated with a 1.5‐Tesla MR‐Linac (MRL). The RTsafe PseudoPatient Prime brain phantom was used with a delineation insert that includes two predefined structures mimicking gadolinium contrast‐enhanced brain lesions. Daily adaptive plans were generated using six preset and six random setup variations. Two adaptive plans per daily MR image were generated using the adapt‐to‐position (ATP) and adapt‐to‐shape (ATS) workflows. An adaptive patient plan was generated on a diagnostic MR image with simulated translational and rotational daily setup variation and was compared with the reference plan. All adaptive plans were compared with the reference plan using the target coverage, Paddick conformity index, gradient index (GI), Brain V12 or V20, optimization time and total monitor units. Target doses were measured as an end‐to‐end test with two ionization chambers inserted into the phantom. With preset translational variations, V12 from the ATS plan was 17% lower than that of the ATP plan. With a larger daily setup variation, GI and V12 of the ATS plan were 10% and 16% lower than those of the ATP plan, respectively. Compared to the ATP plans, the plan quality index of the ATS plans was more consistent with the reference plan, and within 5% in both phantom and patient plans. The differences between the measured and planned target doses were within 1% for both treatment workflows. Treating brain SRS using an MRL is feasible and could achieve satisfactory dosimetric goals. Setup uncertainties could be accounted for using online plan adaptation. The ATS workflow achieved better dosimetric results than the ATP workflow at the cost of longer optimization time.},

abstract={A critical chemotherapeutic complication is cardiotoxicity, often leading, in time, to heart failure. In this work, we developed a novel animal protocol using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and electrophysiology (EP) tests, designed to detect subtle structural and functional changes associated with myocardial damage in sub-chronic phases post-chemotherapy. A weekly dose of doxorubicin (DOX) was injected in four juvenile swine throughout a four-week plan, using an intravenous approach that mimics the treatment in cancer patients. We performed cardiac MR imaging as follows: in all four pigs pre-DOX; at 1 and 5 weeks post-DOX in a group of two pigs; and, at 1 and 9 weeks post-DOX in the other two pigs, using Cine imaging to assess ejection fraction (EF) and late gadolinium enhancement to quantify collagen density in the left ventricle. Additionally, X-ray-guided voltage mapping and arrhythmia tests were conducted in the group at 9 weeks post-DOX and in a healthy pig. Tissue samples were collected for histology. The results showed that EF decreased from ~46% pre-DOX to ~34% within the first 9 weeks post-DOX. This decline in LV function was explained by a gradual increase in collagen density, especially noticeable at week 9 post-DOX as derived from MRI analysis. Furthermore, ventricular fibrillation was induced via rapid pacing at 9 weeks post-DOX, most likely caused by fibrotic patches identified in voltage maps, as confirmed by MRI and collagen-sensitive histological stains. Overall, our novel preclinical protocol was able to reveal key signs of potentially-irreversible tissue changes, along with electrical remodeling and arrhythmia risk in the early months following DOX therapy. Future work will include more datasets to statistically power the study, and will use the protocol to test cardioprotective strategies.},

abstract={Background Foot Function Index (FFI) is a valid and reliable outcome measure, which is widely used to measure the foot and ankle functional level and disorders. Until now, no validated Arabic version of the FFI is available. This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this project was to translate and adapt the FFI into Arabic and to evaluate its psychometric properties of validity and reliability. Methods The study consisted of two phases. The first phase was the translation and cultural adaptation of the FFI to Arabic. The next phase involved, testing the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the FFI on a sample of 50 consecutive participants which included internal consistency, test–retest reliability, floor and ceiling effects and construct validity. Results The mean age of the study participants was 38 ± 12.94 years. Both the genders were evenly enrolled with 50% of the participants as male and 50% as female. Majority of them complained of plantar fasciopathy (32%) followed by pes planus (22%) and ankle sprain (18%). The scores of FFI-Ar were normally distributed, confirmed by a significant Shapiro–Wilk test. The mean value of FFI-Ar total score was 47.73 ± 19.85. There were no floor or ceiling effects seen in any of the subscales and total score. The internal consistency was good with the Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.882, 0.936 and 0.850 for the pain, disability and activity limitation subscales, respectively. The reproducibility of the FFI-Ar was analysed by intra-class correlation coefficient which revealed good to excellent test–retest reliability. A significant correlation was found between FFI-Ar and SF-36 and numeric rating scale (NRS) confirming its construct validity. Conclusion The FFI-Arabic version showed good validity and reliability in patients with foot and ankle problems. This tool can be used in usual practice and research for analysing foot and ankle disorders in Arabic-speaking people.},

abstract={AimsNon-invasive measures of brain iron content would be of great benefit in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) to serve as a biomarker for disease progression and evaluation of iron chelation therapy. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides several quantitative measures of brain iron content, none of these have been validated for patients with a severely increased cerebral iron burden. We aimed to validate R2* as a quantitative measure of brain iron content in aceruloplasminemia, the most severely iron-loaded NBIA phenotype.MethodsTissue samples from 50 gray- and white matter regions of a postmortem aceruloplasminemia brain and control subject were scanned at 1.5 T to obtain R2*, and biochemically analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. For gray matter samples of the aceruloplasminemia brain, sample R2* values were compared with postmortem in situ MRI data that had been obtained from the same subject at 3 T – in situ R2*. Relationships between R2* and tissue iron concentration were determined by linear regression analyses.ResultsMedian iron concentrations throughout the whole aceruloplasminemia brain were 10 to 15 times higher than in the control subject, and R2* was linearly associated with iron concentration. For gray matter samples of the aceruloplasminemia subject with an iron concentration up to 1000 mg/kg, 91% of variation in R2* could be explained by iron, and in situ R2* at 3 T and sample R2* at 1.5 T were highly correlated. For white matter regions of the aceruloplasminemia brain, 85% of variation in R2* could be explained by iron.ConclusionsR2* is highly sensitive to variations in iron concentration in the severely iron-loaded brain, and might be used as a non-invasive measure of brain iron content in aceruloplasminemia and potentially other NBIA disorders.},

abstract={BackgroundBehçet’s disease (BD), commonly seen in the Silk road countries, is a variable vessel vasculitis with no specific investigation that reflects disease activity. The Behçet’s Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) is the most famous and acceptable clinical activity score.PurposeTo develop a cross-cultural adaptation of the BDCAF to the Arabic language (Ar-BDCAF)—Egyptian dialect—across the country and to consider preliminary evaluation of its reliability in assessment of BD activity.Patients and methodsThe score was translated to Arabic language and revised by 3 rheumatology consultants. Reliability of Ar-BDCAF was tested among 88 BD patients from 9 Egyptian main city centers. Patients were questioned by two specialists at 30 min interval to evaluate inter-observer rating and twice by the same physician within 24 h to assess the intra-observer rating.ResultsPatients were 64 males and 24 females (2.7:1) with a mean age of 35 ± 10.3 years. The average time required by the consultant to fill in the form was 5.1 ± 2.2 min (1.5–15 min). The mean Ar-BDCAF scores were 9.81 ± 6.22 (0–25) and 9.53 ± 6.13 (0–28) with an intra-observer concordance (p = 0.28) and was 9.95 ± 6.47 (0–29) for the inter-observer rating (p = 0.89 and p = 0.66, respectively).ConclusionThe Ar-BDCAF is a measurable, easy to calculate, and reliable index for assessing disease activity in Egyptian BD. The Ar-BDCAF score can be used in daily clinical practice to assess BD activity and its use can be extended to other Arab countries for possible regional validation and adaptations. Key Points• The Arabic version of the BDCAF can be extended to other Arab countries for development of a Pan-Arab score.• This is the first study to provide a reliable and valid Arabic version of the BDCAF-Egyptian dialect for measuring current disease activity in BD patients.},

abstract={Introduction The aim was to validate the dosimetric and geometric accuracy of radiotherapy treatment plans for prostate cancer based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging only and a solution based on computed tomography (CT) supported by MR imaging. Material and methods We used CT and MR images of ten prostate cancer patients implanted with three fiducial markers (FM) in the prostate gland. Rigid registration based on FM was performed to assess the fusion accuracy between MR and CT images. The differences between prostate contours (clinical target volume – CTV) on CT (CTVCT) and MR (CTVMR) images were scored using the Dice similarity coefficient and directly comparing the outlined volumes. The volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were designed and optimised on synthetic CT (sCT) to obtain the dose distribution for the MR-only solution. In the next step, the sCT images were replaced by conventional CT images and the plans were recalculated. The doses obtained on sCT and CT were compared by direct dose subtraction and the gamma method. Results The averaged fiducial registration error was equal to 0.5 mm. All CTVCT volumes were significantly bigger than corresponding CTV delineated on MR images (p = 0.005). The direct dose comparison shows that for 97.1% of patients’ bodies, the differences were smaller than 0.1%. The average gamma passing rates were higher than 0.970. Conclusions MR imaging allows for a more precise delineation of the prostate compared to CT imaging. The workflow of plan preparation based on MR and CT is burdened with an FM registration error that is eliminated by an MR-only solution with no compromise on dose distribution.},

abstract={ObjectiveTest a practical realignment approach to compensate the technical variability of MR radiomic features.MethodsT1 phantom images acquired on 2 scanners, FLAIR and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) images of 18 brain tumor patients scanned on both 1.5-T and 3-T scanners, and 36 T2-weighted (T2w) images of prostate cancer patients scanned in one of two centers were investigated. The ComBat procedure was used for harmonizing radiomic features. Differences in statistical distributions in feature values between 1.5- and 3-T images were tested before and after harmonization. The prostate studies were used to determine the impact of harmonization to distinguish between Gleason grades (GGs).ResultsIn the phantom data, 40 out of 42 radiomic feature values were significantly different between the 2 scanners before harmonization and none after. In white matter regions, the statistical distributions of features were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the 1.5- and 3-T images for 37 out of 42 features in both FLAIR and CE-T1w images. After harmonization, no statistically significant differences were observed. In brain tumors, 41 (FLAIR) or 36 (CE-T1w) out of 42 features were significantly different between the 1.5- and 3-T images without harmonization, against 1 (FLAIR) or none (CE-T1w) with harmonization. In prostate studies, 636 radiomic features were significantly different between GGs after harmonization against 461 before. The ability to distinguish between GGs using radiomic features was increased after harmonization.ConclusionComBat harmonization efficiently removes inter-center technical inconsistencies in radiomic feature values and increases the sensitivity of studies using data from several scanners.Key Points• Radiomic feature values obtained using different MR scanners or imaging protocols can be harmonized by combining off-the-shelf image standardization and feature realignment procedures.• Harmonized radiomic features enable one to pool data from different scanners and centers without a substantial loss of statistical power caused by intra- and inter-center variability.• The proposed realignment method is applicable to radiomic features from different MR sequences and tumor types and does not rely on any phantom acquisition.},

abstract={Simple SummaryHyperthermia treatments where tumor tissue is heated to 40–44 °C for 60–90 min can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. To solve this need, we have designed an MR compatible head and neck hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we experimentally validated the design, heating capabilities and the MR compatibility of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas efficiently transfer the power and have low interaction between the antenna elements. The heating and focusing capabilities satisfy the requirements. The MRcollar can operate in an MR scanner and it can acquire higher quality MR images due to the built in receiver elements. The MRcollar has great potential to improve hyperthermia treatment in the head and neck region and it is now ready for in vivo studies.AbstractClinical effectiveness of hyperthermia treatments, in which tumor tissue is artificially heated to 40–44 °C for 60–90 min, can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. The need for noninvasive temperature monitoring in the head and neck region (H&N) and the potential of MR thermometry prompt us to design an MR compatible hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we validate the design, numerical model, and MR performance of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas have low reflection coefficients (<−15 dB) and the intended low interaction between the individual antenna modules (<−32 dB). A 10 °C increase in 3 min was reached in a muscle-equivalent phantom, such that the specifications from the European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology were easily reached. The MRcollar had a minimal effect on MR image quality and a five-fold improvement in SNR was achieved using the integrated coils of the MRcollar, compared to the body coil. The feasibility of using the MRcollar in an MR environment was shown by a synchronous heating experiment. The match between the predicted SAR and measured SAR using MR thermometry satisfied the gamma criteria distance-to-agreement = 5 mm, dose-difference = 7%]. All experiments combined show that the MRcollar delivers on the needs for MR—hyperthermia in the H&N and is ready for in vivo investigation.},

abstract={Featured ApplicationAircraft Shock Absorber with Controllable Damping Force.AbstractThis work presents a novel design model of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based shock absorber (MR shock absorber in short) that can be applied to an aircraft landing gear system. When an external force acts on an MR shock absorber, pressure loss occurs at the flow path while resisting the fluid flow. During the flow motion, two pressure losses occur: the major loss, which is proportional to the flow rate, and the minor loss, which is proportional to the square of the flow rate. In general, when an MR shock absorber is designed for low stroke velocity systems such as an automotive suspension system, the consideration of the major loss only for the design model is well satisfied by experimental results. However, when an MR shock absorber is applied to dynamic systems that require high stroke velocity, such as aircraft landing gear systems, the minor loss effect becomes significant to the pressure drop. In this work, a new design model for an MR shock absorber, considering both the major and minor pressure losses, is proposed. After formulating a mathematical design model, a prototype of an MR shock absorber is manufactured based on the design parameters of a lightweight aircraft landing gear system. After establishing a drop test for the MR shock absorber, the results of the pressure drop versus stroke/stroke velocity are investigated at different impact energies. It is shown from comparative evaluation that the proposed design model agrees with the experiment much better than the model that considers only the major pressure loss.},

abstract={Simple SummaryIn soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients, the decision for the optimal treatment modality largely depends on STS size, location, and a pathological measure that assesses tumor aggressiveness called “tumor grading”. To determine tumor grading, invasive biopsies are needed before therapy. In previous research studies, quantitative imaging features (“radiomics”) have been associated with tumor grading. In this work, we assessed the possibility of predicting tumor grading using an artificial intelligence technique called “deep learning” or “convolutional neural networks”. By analyzing either T1-weighted or T2-weighted MRI sequences, non-invasive tumor grading prediction was possible in an independent test patient cohort. The results were comparable to previous research work obtained with radiomics; however, the reproducibility of the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence was improved. The T2-based model was also able to significantly identify patients with a high risk for death after therapy.AbstractBackground: In patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, tumor grading constitutes a decisive factor to determine the best treatment decision. Tumor grading is obtained by pathological work-up after focal biopsies. Deep learning (DL)-based imaging analysis may pose an alternative way to characterize STS tissue. In this work, we sought to non-invasively differentiate tumor grading into low-grade (G1) and high-grade (G2/G3) STS using DL techniques based on MR-imaging. Methods: Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated (T1FSGd) MRI sequences and fat-saturated T2-weighted (T2FS) sequences were collected from two independent retrospective cohorts (training: 148 patients, testing: 158 patients). Tumor grading was determined following the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group in pre-therapeutic biopsies. DL models were developed using transfer learning based on the DenseNet 161 architecture. Results: The T1FSGd and T2FS-based DL models achieved area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.75 and 0.76 on the test cohort, respectively. T1FSGd achieved the best F1-score of all models (0.90). The T2FS-based DL model was able to significantly risk-stratify for overall survival. Attention maps revealed relevant features within the tumor volume and in border regions. Conclusions: MRI-based DL models are capable of predicting tumor grading with good reproducibility in external validation.},

abstract={PurposeGlioma treatment planning requires precise tumor delineation, which is typically performed with contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI. However, CE MRI fails to reflect the entire extent of glioma. O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET may detect tumor volumes missed by CE MRI. We investigated the clinical value of simultaneous FET-PET and CE MRI in delineating tumor extent before treatment planning. Guided stereotactic biopsy was used to validate the findings.MethodsConventional MRI and 18F-FET PET were performed simultaneously on a hybrid PET/MR in 33 patients with histopathologically confirmed glioma. Tumor volumes were quantified using a tumor-to-brain ratio ≥ 1.6 (VPET) and a visual threshold (VCE). We visually assessed abnormal areas on FLAIR images and calculated Dice’s coefficient (DSC), overlap volume (OV), discrepancy-PET, and discrepancy-CE. Additionally, several stereotactic biopsy samples were taken from “matched” or “mismatched” FET-PET and CE MRI regions.ResultsAmong 31 patients (93.94%), FET-PET delineated significantly larger tumor volumes than CE MRI (77.84 ± 51.74 cm3 vs. 34.59 ± 27.07 cm3, P < 0.05). Of the 21 biopsy samples obtained from regions with increased FET uptake, all were histopathologically confirmed as glioma tissue or tumor infiltration, whereas only 13 showed enhancement on CE MRI. Among all patients, the spatial similarity between VPET and VCE was low (average DSC 0.56 ± 0.22), while the overlap was high (average OV 0.95 ± 0.08). The discrepancy-CE and discrepancy-PET were lower than 10% in 28 and 0 patients, respectively. Eleven patients showed VPET partially beyond abnormal signal areas on FLAIR images.ConclusionThe metabolically active biodistribution of gliomas delineated with FET-PET significantly exceeds tumor volume on CE MRI, and histopathology confirms these findings. Our preliminary results indicate that combining the anatomic and molecular information obtained from conventional MRI and FET-PET would reveal a more accurate glioma extent, which is critical for individualized treatment planning.},

Here 2 DCE paramaters are reported:Ktrans(min-1), volume transfer constant for CA between blood plasma and extravascular extracellular space; estimated using the extended Tofts model(5 with population arterial function(;6 and IAUC60(mM.s), initial area under CA concentration curve over 60 s post-arrival. Manual segmentation was performed by radiologist. Results Test-retest coefficient of variation(CoV) was lower in controls. Ktranshad CoVs of 26/16% in OA patients/controls. An effect size of 30% reduction in Ktrans(,4 indicates a treatment effect would be observed in a group of 11 patients with 90% power. DCE parameters were generally higher in OA patients than in controls. 4 out of 9 patients (All with KL score 3)demonstrated parameter values outside the healthy volunteer range at p<0.01 level (one sample t-test). Abstract AB1186 - Table 1 Age(mean±SD) BMI(mean±SD) #KL-grade 2/3 #MOAKS effusion synovitis grade 0/1/2 #MOAKS Hoffa synovitis grad 0/1 Patient (n=9, 4F) 52±5.2 30±4.15 5/4 5/1/3 7/2 control (n=4, 3F) 55±3.0 30±3.50 NA 3/1/0 3/1 Conclusions Higher Ktransand IAUC60in patients indicates the potential of revealing microvascular function differences. The fact that this is not observed in all patients could suggest phenotypical variation. High CoV values in patient relative to healthy may be explained in part by fluctuation in disease status. Manual delineation also contributes to this variation. DCE-MRI measures of vascular disruption associated with synovitis in knee OA are practical and feasible for imaging trials. These measures offer greater insight and sensitivity into the inflammatory component of OA that is not captured using other radiological methods. 1] Roemer, et al.

abstract={Introduction Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) is a promising non-invasive imaging tool in viability and cardiomyopathy, quantifying infarct size more accurately than late-gadolinium enhancement, as we previously demonstrated. We aimed to validate MEMRI viability against 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET). Methods Sprague-Dawley rats (male; 180-300 g) underwent permanent surgical anterior myocardial infarction (n=11), or sham surgery (n=2), with dual MEMRI and 18F-FDG PET assessment at 12 weeks. MEMRI (7 T spectrometer, Agilent, UK) was achieved with intravenous manganese gluconate (EVP1001-1, Eagle-Vision-Pharmaceuticals, USA; n=6, 22 μmol/kg) and mangafodipir (Teslascan, IC-Targets, Norway; n=7, 44 μmol/kg). Anatomical and functional imaging preceded cardiac-gated Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MoLLI) before and 20 min post-contrast (at maximal infarct slice). Commercially available software generated standardised T1 maps for ROI-contouring. For PET imaging, intravenous 18F-FDG (20-30 MBq) was administered with PET data acquired for 60 min, followed by cardiac-gated acquisition (10 min). PET/MR images were co-registered and fused for analysis. Results Infarct size assessed by MEMRI T1 mapping was smaller than by native T1 at 12 weeks (mean 23.34 vs 18.68%; p=0.001). Native T1 mapping consistently overestimated infarct size (bias 25.76; 95% CI: 7.51 to 44.01; p=0.031) but there was excellent agreement between MEMRI T1 mapping and 18F-FDG (bias 1.30; 95% CI: -24.98 to 25.57; p=0.7). Post-MEMRI T1 values showed negative trend with increasing SUV (r2=0.25, p=0.08) whereas native T1 demonstrated no relationship (r2=0.0001, p>0.9). Conclusion MEMRI T1 mapping identifies viable myocardium as well as 18F-FDG PET and was superior to native T1 mapping. Post-MEMRI T1 appears related to SUV where native T1 does not. This validation data informs the clinical translation of cardiac MEMRI.},

abstract={Objectives To validate MR textural analysis (MRTA) for detection of transition zone (TZ) prostate cancer through comparison with co-registered prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-MR. Methods Retrospective analysis was performed for 30 men who underwent simultaneous PSMA PET-MR imaging for staging of prostate cancer. Thirty texture features were derived from each manually contoured T2-weighted, transaxial, prostatic TZ using texture analysis software that applies a spatial band-pass filter and quantifies texture through histogram analysis. Texture features of the TZ were compared to PSMA expression on the corresponding PET images. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controlled the false discovery rate at <5%. Results Eighty-eight T2-weighted images in 18 patients demonstrated abnormal PSMA expression within the TZ on PET-MR. 123 images were PSMA negative. Based on the corrected p-value of 0.005, significant differences between PSMA positive and negative slices were found for 16 texture parameters: Standard deviation and mean of positive pixels for all spatial filters (p = <0.0001 for both at all spatial scaling factor (SSF) values) and mean intensity following filtration for SSF 3–6 mm (p = 0.0002–0.0018). Conclusion Abnormal expression of PSMA within the TZ is associated with altered texture on T2-weighted MR, providing validation of MRTA for the detection of TZ prostate cancer. Key Points • Prostate transition zone (TZ) MR texture analysis may assist in prostate cancer detection. • Abnormal transition zone PSMA expression correlates with altered texture on T2-weighted MR. • TZ with abnormal PSMA expression demonstrates significantly reduced MI, SD and MPP.},

abstract={In the present prospective study, the functional outcomes of non-operative treatment were evaluated in patients aged between 30 and 45 years presenting SLAP lesion in diagnostic provocative tests and magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography. Forty-six patients with a symptomatic SLAP lesion who participated in recreational level of sports were prospectively enroled. SLAP lesion was diagnosed using combinations of several clinical tests and MR arthrography findings. All patients were treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections, followed by rotator cuff and periscapular muscle-strengthening exercises. Patients with persistent discomfort after second injection underwent arthroscopic SLAP repair. Functional outcomes were evaluated using ASES and Constant scores, and pain and satisfaction for visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain had significantly improved from 5.2 ± 2.2 to 1.0 ± 1.1 (p < 0.001) in all patients after the first corticosteroid injection. SLAP symptoms relapsed in 12 patients at an average of 2.4 months after the first injection. Symptoms were relieved in 5 of 12 patients after the second injection and strengthening exercises. The remaining seven patients underwent arthroscopic SLAP repair. Thirty-nine patients (85 %) who were treated non-operatively showed improved VAS, Constant, and ASES scores at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Non-operative treatment with an appropriate regimen provided satisfactory clinical outcomes in middle-aged patients with symptomatic SLAP lesions and should be considered before recommending operative treatment. Non-operative management using combined intra-articular corticosteroid injection with rotator cuff and periscapular strengthening exercises could be applied as primary treatment for patients with symptomatic SLAP lesion who participate in recreational level of sports.

abstract={Objectives To evaluate the value of the chemical shift effect (CSE) as well as other criteria for the prediction of lymph node status. Materials and methods Twenty-nine patients who underwent radical surgery of rectal cancers were studied with pre- and postoperative specimen MRI. Lymph nodes were harvested from transverse whole-mount specimens and compared with in vivo and ex vivo images to obtain a precise slice-for-section match. Preoperative MR characteristics including CSE, as well as other predictors, were evaluated by two readers independently between benign and metastatic nodes. Results A total of 255 benign and 35 metastatic nodes were obtained; 71.4% and 69.4% of benign nodes were detected with regular CSE for two readers, whereas 80.0% and 74.3% of metastatic nodes with absence of CSE. The CSE rendered areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.879 and 0.845 for predicting nodal status for two readers. The criteria of nodal location, border, signal intensity and minimum distance to the rectal wall were also useful but with AUCs (0.629-0.743) lower than those of CSE. Conclusions CSE is a reliable predictor for differentiating benign from metastatic nodes. Additional criteria should be taken into account when it is difficult to determine the nodal status by using only a single predictor. Key Points * CSE is good for predicting nodal status with high confidence. * Nodal border and signal intensity are useful for assessing nodal status. * Location of mesorectal nodes could facilitate the prediction of nodal status. * Primary tumour stage could be used as reference for nodal staging.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore differences in image quality between PET/MR and PET/CT hybrid imaging systems using standard quality control and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) tests. METHODS Image acquisition and quality control tests were investigated according to the standards of NEMA NU 2-2007 using NEMA phantom and recommended image acquisition techniques. The phantom consists of lesion-like hot spheres of diameters 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm filled with 8:1 18F activity ratio to background. The remaining 28 and 37 mm cold spheres were filled with water only. A 700-mm linear line source was prepared with 3.08 mCi (140.6 MBq), and all essential ROIs were drawn after image acquisition to calculate contrast. RESULTS In PET/MR, the average contrast of 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm diameter hot spheres in the phantom was 56%, 72%, 78%, and 85%, respectively. While the contrast of 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm diameter hot spheres in PET/CT was 53%, 66%, 72%, and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSION PET/MR image contrast was higher than PET/CT by 9%.},

abstract={The characteristics of a dual-pulse shock caused by an UNDEX (underwater explosion) are described through many standards. Shock signals required to evaluate the survivability of equipment by a shock test machine are also described. To generate various types of shock signals described in the standard, Shock test machines (STMs) require adjustment to various levels of shock occurring in surface ships and submarines. Therefore, the characteristics of each component of a STM should be changeable to generate various shock signals. This paper describes the concept of a STM that can generate various types of dual-pulse shocks. Moreover, this paper suggests an analytic method to determine the characteristics of each component of a STM to generate the required shock signal for various specimens. A method for adjusting the shock signals using a magnetorheological damper is specifically suggested. The results of dynamic analysis using the characteristic values of each component determined by this method shows that the required shock signal can be generated by this concept of the shock test machine.},

abstract={Background Up to 80 % of cartilage is water; the rest is collagen fibers and proteoglycans. Magnetic resonance (MR) T1-weighted measurements can be employed to calculate the water content of a tissue using T1 mapping. In this study, a method that translates T1 values into water content data was tested statistically. Materials and methods To develop a predictive equation, T1 values were obtained for tissue-mimicking gelatin samples. 1.5 T MRI was performed using inverse angle phase and an inverse sequence at 37 (±0.5) °C. Regions of interest were manually delineated and the mean T1 value was estimated in arbitrary units. Data were collected and modeled using linear regression. To validate the method, articular cartilage from six healthy pigs was used. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the Danish Animal Experiment Committee. Double measurements were performed for each animal. Ex vivo, all water in the tissue was extracted by lyophilization, thus allowing the volume of water to be measured. This was then compared with the predicted water content via Lin's concordance correlation coefficient at the 95 % confidence level. Results The mathematical model was highly significant when compared to a null model (p < 0.0001). 97.3 % of the variation in water content can be explained by absolute T1 values. Percentage water content could be predicted as 0.476 + (T1 value) × 0.000193 × 100 %. We found that there was 98 % concordance between the actual and predicted water contents. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate that MR data can be used to predict percentage water contents of cartilage samples. Level of evidence 3 (case-control study).},

abstract={Objectives The aim was to determine the proton MR (1H-MR) spectra of normal adult testes and variations with age. Methods Forty-one MR spectra of normal testes, including 16 testes from men aged 20-39 years (group I) and 25 testes from men aged 40-69 years (group II), were analyzed. A single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS), with TR/TE: 2000/25 ms was used. The volume of interest was placed to include the majority of normal testicular parenchyma. Association between normalized metabolite concentrations, defined as ratios of the calculated metabolite concentrations relative to creatine concentration, and age was assessed. Results Quantified metabolites of the spectra were choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mI), scyllo-inositol, taurine, lactate, GLx compound, glucose, lipids, and macromolecules resonating at 0.9 ppm (LM09), around 20 ppm (LM20), and at 13 ppm (LM13). Most prominent peaks were Cho, Cr, mI, and lipids. A weak negative correlation between mI and age (P=0.015) was observed. Higher normalized concentrations of Cho (P=0.03), mI (P=0.08), and LM13 (P=0.05) were found in group I than in group II. Conclusions 1H-MR spectra of a normal adult testis showed several metabolite peaks. A decrease of levels of Cho, mI, and LM13 was observed with advancing age. Key Points * Single-voxel PRESS MRS of a normal testis is feasible. * 1H-MR spectra of a normal testis showed several metabolite peaks. * Most prominent peaks were Cho, Cr, mI, and lipids. * A decrease of Cho, mI, and LM13 was seen with advancing age.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion MR imaging for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect as alternatives to dynamic-susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion MR imaging when the DSC image is uninterpretable. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. Seventy one post-treatment glioblastoma patients who showed enlarged contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up MR images after concurrent chemoradiotherapy and uninterpretable DSC images for corresponding enhancing lesions, underwent additional DWI and DCE MR imaging. The primary outcome was the frequency of interpretable DWI and DCE MR cases in these 71 patients. The secondary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DWI and DCE imaging parameters for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images. The imaging parameters were quantified as 10% cumulative histogram cutoff of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC10) and 90% cumulative histogram cutoff of initial area under the time signal intensity curve (IAUC90). The AUCs were cross-validated by using leave-one-out method. Results Of the 71 patients, the uninterpretable DSC images were associated with treatment-related hemorrhage within the corresponding enhancing lesions (n = 54, 76.1%) and a near skull base location (n = 17, 23.9%). The frequencies of interpretable DWI and DCE image were 51 (71.8%) and 59 (83.1%) of the 71 cases with uninterpretable DSC images, respectively. Of the 45 selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images, the combination of DWI with DCE imaging showed a superior diagnostic performance than DWI or DCE imaging alone for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect (cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.55 and 0.73 for reader 1; cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.53 and 0.75 for reader 2, respectively). Cross-validated accuracy of the single and combined imaging parameters also showed the highest for the combination of DWI with DCE MR imaging (72.9% for reader 1; 72.5% for reader 2) and the lowest for DWI alone (54.0% for reader 1; 56.4% for reader 2). Inter-reader agreement for DCE imaging was higher than that for DWI (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.95 versus 0.87). Conclusion DCE MR imaging could be a superior and more reproducible imaging biomarker than DWI for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in patients with post-treatment glioblastoma when DSC MR images are not interpretable.},

abstract={The EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI is distorted by a number of artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts, associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat, reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However, a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused by the Helium cooling pump, and propose a method for its reduction and respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since the Helium cooling pump artefact was found to be repetitive, an average template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact spectral peaks by 95 ± 2 % while the background spectral amplitude within those peaks was reduced by only -5 ± 4 %. Although the Helium cooling pump should ideally be switched off during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post processing.},

abstract={Radio-frequency coil arrays using dipole antenna technique have been recently applied for ultrahigh field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to obtain the better signal–noise-ratio (SNR) gain at the deep area of human tissues. However, the unique structure of dipole antennas makes it challenging to achieve sufficient electromagnetic decoupling among the dipole antenna elements. Currently, there is no decoupling methods proposed for dipole antenna arrays in MR imaging. The recently developed magnetic wall (MW) or induced current elimination decoupling technique has demonstrated its feasibility and robustness in designing microstrip transmission line arrays, L/C loop arrays and monopole arrays. In this study, we aim to investigate the possibility and performance of MW decoupling technique in dipole arrays for MR imaging at the ultrahigh field of 7T. To achieve this goal, a two-channel MW decoupled dipole array was designed, constructed and analyzed experimentally through bench test and MR imaging. Electromagnetic isolation between the two dipole elements was improved from about −3.6 dB (without any decoupling treatments) to −16.5 dB by using the MW decoupling method. MR images acquired from a water phantom using the MW decoupled dipole array and the geometry factor maps were measured, calculated and compared with those acquired using the dipole array without decoupling treatments. The MW decoupled dipole array demonstrated well-defined image profiles from each element and had better geometry factor over the array without decoupling treatments. The experimental results indicate that the MW decoupling technique might be a promising solution to reducing the electromagnetic coupling of dipole arrays in ultrahigh field MRI, consequently improving their performance in SNR and parallel imaging.},

abstract={The level set approach to segmentation of medical images has received considerable attention in recent years. Evolving an initial contour to converge to anatomical boundaries of an organ or tumor is a very appealing method, especially when it is based on a well-defined mathematical foundation. However, one drawback of such evolving method is its high computation time. It is desirable to design and implement algorithms that are not only accurate and robust but also fast in execution. Bresson et al. have proposed a variational model using both boundary and region information as well as shape priors. The latter can be a significant factor in medical image analysis. In this work, we combine the variational model of level set with a multi-resolution approach to accelerate the processing. The question is whether a multi-resolution context can make the segmentation faster without affecting the accuracy. As well, we investigate the question whether a premature convergence, which happens in a much shorter time, would reduce accuracy. We examine multiple semiautomated configurations to segment the prostate gland in T2W MR images. Comprehensive experimentation is conducted using a data set of a 100 patients (1,235 images) to verify the effectiveness of the multi-resolution level set with shape priors. The results show that the convergence speed can be increased by a factor of asymptotically =]2.5 without affecting the segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, a premature convergence approach drastically increases the segmentation speed by a factor of asymptotically =]17.9.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={An effective damper is required to give good performance over a wide range of vibrational frequencies. To achieve this, the damping coefficient of the damper must be variable. The Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids are the fluids used in this type of dampers to achieve the objective. In this paper, a mathematical design of the MR damper is presented. For this, the magnetic circuit of the MR damper is designed and analyzed, which subsequently determines the damping force at different magnetic fields applied to it. The magnetic field can be controlled by the current input given to the electromagnet. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on ANSYS platform is carried out to obtain magnetic flux density in the working space of the damper. The damping force of the FEM model is determined for the damper. Lastly, these two models are validated experimentally in terms of damping force at various input current levels. For this purpose, a prototype of the MR damper is fabricated and tested in the newly setup vibration control laboratory of the department. A comparative analysis of the three models shows that the maximum percentage error in the damping force is within the 12% level with the experimental one and thus validates the mathematical and FEM modeling. The results obtained will be helpful for the automobile designers to create more efficient and reliable MR dampers and also to predict its damping force characteristics.},

abstract={There is a close relation between cartilage health and its hydration state. Current magnetic resonance methods allow visualizing this tissue. However, a quantitative analysis is more useful when studying disease. The purpose of this study was to quantify water content in cartilage using magnetic resonance without contrast agents. Water-content estimations using T1 magnetic resonance mapping were done first in eight gelatin samples where the water content was previously known. The same method was used in the physeal areas of eight skeletally immature 30-kg pigs. To calculate accuracy, T1 calculations were compared to dry-freeze, which is considered the gold standard because it can remove the total water content form a tissue. Four fresh cartilage and seven gelatin samples were dry-frozen. Water content obtained from dry-freeze was compared to the one calculated from T1 map values. A mathematical model and statistical analysis were used to calculate the predictive value of the method and its significance. T1-map-based magnetic resonance method can calculate water content in cartilage with an accuracy of 97.3 %. We calculated a coefficient of variance for this method against dry-frozen sample of 3.68 (SD=1.2) in gelatin samples, and 2.73 (SD=1.3) in in vivo samples. Between two independent observers, the coefficient of variance was 0.053, which suggests it can be easily reproduced. Magnetic resonance was able to calculate, with high accuracy, the cartilage water content using T1 mapping sequences.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Introduction MR enterography (MRE) aids assessment of small bowel (SB) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to determine the frequency and clinical impact of incidental findings detected by MRE in patients with suspected or known Crohn's disease (CD). Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 948 MRE studies performed between June 2009 and December 2012 at our institution. Clinical data (demographics, disease characteristics and therapy) were obtained from electronic patient records. Incidental findings were defined as unexpected lesions in or outside the small intestine, previously unknown or unsuspected at the time of referral and unrelated to IBD. Results Of 948 MRE studies 445 patients had a diagnosis of IBD, 385 had CD, 54 had ulcerative colitis and 16 had IBD unclassified (IBDU). Of 385 CD patients, 224 were female, mean age 36 (range 12-72) and median follow up of 4 years (range 0-39). Abnormalities were noted in 285 scans, 162 active non-stricturing, 109 active stricturing and 13-fibrostenosis. Within active groups were 29 fistulae and 12 abscesses in 33 patients. Incidental findings included colitis (10), gallstones (17), ovarian cyst (15), sacroileitis (1), renal cyst (10), hepatic cyst (10), splenic haemangioma (1), mesenteric abscess (1), adrenal nodule (2), uterine fibroid (4), chronic pancreatitis (1) and splenomegaly (2) associated with portal vein thrombosis in and varices. 70 studies were performed in UC or IBDU; mean age 34 (range 15-82) 39 were female. Small bowel thickening with signs of active inflammation were seen in 9/13. Other findings included a fluid filled collection in the right ischio-anal fossa, pancreatic divisum, gallstones and liver, ovarian and Nabothian cysts, colitis in 6 and colonic polyps in 1. Indications for MRE in the non-IBD group (503 patients) included iron deficiency anaemia, abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhoea, vomiting, abnormal colonoscopy or intra-abdominal abscess. Findings included small bowel thickening (4), sub-acute small bowel obstruction (2), small bowel malignancies (2), small bowel stricture (1) and small bowel intussusception (1). Incidental findings included ovarian, hepatic and renal cysts, adrenal adenoma, ascites, splenic and liver haemangioma, AAA, PUJ obstruction, liver metastases, gallstones, gallbladder polyp, pelvic abscess, uterine fibroids, large bowel stricture, diverticular disease, cirrhosis, lymphadenopathy, horseshoe kidney, atrophic pancreas and acute appendicitis. Conclusion A small but significant proportion of patients have important incidental findings at MRE. MRE can add meaningfully to the investigation of SB pathology. A careful selection of patients can be achieved through a collaborative approach between radiologists and clinicians. Disclosure of Interest None Declared.},

abstract={Before diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be implemented in standard clinical practice for response monitoring, data on reproducibility are needed to assess which differences outside the range of normal variation can be detected in an individual patient. In this study we assessed the reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in colorectal liver metastases. To provide a biological basis for these values, their relation with histopathology was assessed. DWI was performed twice in 1 week in patients scheduled for metastasectomy of colorectal liver metastases. Correlation between ADC values and apoptosis marker p53, anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, proliferation marker Ki67 and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration were assessed. A good reproducibility coefficient of the mean ADC (coefficient of reproducibility 0.20 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s) was observed in colorectal liver metastases (n=21). The ADC value was related to the proliferation index and BCL-2 expression of the metastases. Furthermore, in metastases recently treated with systemic therapy, the ADC was significantly higher (1.27 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s vs 1.05 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s, P=0.02). The good reproducibility, correlation with histopathology and implied sensitivity for systemic treatment-induced anti-tumour effects suggest that DWI might be an excellent tool to monitor response in metastatic colorectal cancer. * ADC values are becoming important oncological biomarkers * DWI provides reproducibile ADC values in colorectal liver metastases * The coefficient of reproducibility of the mean ADC is 0.20 × 10 ^sup -3^ mm ^sup 2^ /s * ADC values correlate with proliferation index and are related to BCL-2 expression PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Compared with X-ray coronary angiography (CAG), magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary vessel wall (MR-CVW) may provide more information about plaque burden and coronary remodelling. We compared MR-CVW with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), the standard of reference for coronary vessel wall imaging, with regard to plaque detection and wall thickness measurements. In this study 17 patients with chest pain, who had been referred for CAG, were included. Patients underwent IVUS and MR-CVW imaging of the right coronary artery (RCA). Subsequently, the coronary vessel wall was analysed for the presence and location of coronary plaques. Fifty-two matching RCA regions of interest were available for comparison. There was good agreement between IVUS and MR-CVW for qualitative assessment of presence of disease, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 76%. Wall thickness measurements demonstrated a significant difference between mean wall thickness on IVUS and MR-CVW (0.48 vs 1.24 mm, P<0.001), but great heterogeneity between wall thickness measurements, resulting in a low correlation between IVUS and MR-CVW. MR-CVW has high sensitivity for the detection of coronary vessel wall thickening in the RCA compared with IVUS. However, the use of MRI for accurate absolute wall thickness measurements is not supported when a longitudinal acquisition orientation is used. * Both MRI and IVUS can assess coronary vessels * Both MRI and IVUS can identify coronary vessel wall thickening. * MRI provides more information about the coronary plaque burden than conventional angiography. * However, MRI overestimates absolute coronary wall thickness when compared with IVUS.

abstract={Introduction Low muscle mass secondary to disease and ageing is an important cause of excess mortality and morbidity. Many studies include a MR brain scan but no peripheral measure of muscle mass. We developed a technique to measure posterior neck muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) on volumetric MR brain scans enabling brain and muscle size to be measured simultaneously. Methods We performed four studies to develop and test: feasibility, inter-rater reliability, repeatability and external validity. We used T1-weighted MR brain imaging from young and older subjects, obtained on different scanners, and collected mid-thigh MR data. Results After developing the technique and demonstrating feasibility, we tested it for inter-rater reliability in 40 subjects. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between raters were 0.99 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.98–1.00) for the combined group (trapezius, splenius and semispinalis), 0.92 (CI 0.85–0.96) for obliquus and 0.92 (CI 0.85–0.96) for sternocleidomastoid. The first unrotated principal component explained 72.2% of total neck muscle CSA variance and correlated positively with both right (r = 0.52, p = .001) and left (r = 0.50, p = .002) grip strength. The 14 subjects in the repeatability study had had two MR brain scans on three different scanners. The ICC for between scanner variation for total neck muscle CSA was high at 0.94 (CI 0.86–0.98). The ICCs for within scanner variations were also high, with values of 0.95 (CI 0.86–0.98), 0.97 (CI 0.92–0.99) and 0.96 (CI 0.86–0.99) for the three scanners. The external validity study found a correlation coefficient for total thigh CSA and total neck CSA of 0.88. Discussion We present a feasible, valid and reliable method for measuring neck muscle CSA on T1-weighted MR brain scans. Larger studies are needed to validate and apply our technique with subjects differing in age, ethnicity and geographical location.},

abstract={Magnetic resonance‐guided high‐intensity focused ultrasound (MR‐HIFU) is a noninvasive image‐guided technique used to thermally ablate solid tumors. During treatment, ultrasound reflections from distal media interfaces can shift prescribed treatment locations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of normal incidence reflections from air, acrylic (modeling bone), and rubber on treatment location, temperature elevation, and heating patterns by performing ultrasound exposures in a tissue‐mimicking phantom and in ex vivo porcine tissue using a clinical MR‐HIFU platform. The results demonstrated a shift in treatment location toward the distal interface when targeted closer than 2 cm from the interface, especially for acrylic. Our study demonstrated that the ultrasound wave reflections from a distal air interface had less effect than the acrylic interface (modeling bone) on the heating pattern and focal location. This study provides useful information to better understand the limitations and safety concerns of performing MR‐HIFU treatments with commercial clinical equipment.PACS numbers: 87.61.‐c, 87.63.D},

abstract={Multimodal approaches are of growing interest in the study of neural processes. To this end much attention has been paid to the integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data because of their complementary properties. However, the simultaneous acquisition of both types of data causes serious artifacts in the EEG, with amplitudes that may be much larger than those of EEG signals themselves. The most challenging of these artifacts is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, caused by pulse-related electrode movements inside the magnetic field. Despite numerous efforts to find a suitable approach to remove this artifact, still a considerable discrepancy exists between current EEG-fMRI studies. This paper attempts to clarify several methodological issues regarding the different approaches with an extensive validation based on event-related potentials (ERPs). More specifically, Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based methods were investigated. Their validation was not only performed with measures known from previous studies on the average ERPs, but most attention was focused on task-related measures, including their use on trial-to-trial information. These more detailed validation criteria enabled us to find a clearer distinction between the most widely used cleaning methods. Both OBS and ICA proved to be able to yield equally good results. However, ICA methods needed more parameter tuning, thereby making OBS more robust and easy to use. Moreover, applying OBS prior to ICA can optimize the data quality even more, but caution is recommended since the effect of the additional ICA step may be strongly subject-dependent.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of adding combined 18F-PET/CT to MRI for T and N staging of the oral and oropharyngeal cancer and calculation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) having histopathology as reference standard. PET/CT and MRI were performed in 66 patients with suspected oral and oropharyngeal cancer (41 primary tumors/25 recurrent tumors) and nodal disease (114 nodes). Statistical analysis included the McNemar test, sensitivity, specificity for the diagnostic modalities as well as regression analysis, and Bland-Altman graphs for calculated tumor volumes. There was no statistically significant difference between the two modalities compared to pathological findings regarding detection of disease (P≥0.72). The sensitivity/specificity for tumor detection were 100/80% and 96.72/60% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. The sensitivity/specificity for nodal metastases were 88.46/75% and 83.81/73.91% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. In 18% of cases, the MRI-based T staging resulted in an overestimation of the pathologic tumor stage. The corresponding rate for PET/CT was 22%. Regarding the treated necks, both modalities showed 100% sensitivity for detection of the recurrent lesions. In necks with histologically N0 staging, MRI and PET/CT gave 22% and 26% false positive findings, respectively. The mean tumor volume in the pathologic specimen was 16.6±18.6 ml, the mean volume derived by the MR imaging was 17.6±19.1 ml while the estimated by PET/CT volume was 18.8±18.1 ml (P≤0.007 between the three methods). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a better agreement between PET/CT and MRI. The diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in the local staging of oral cancer is not superior to MRI.

abstract={Interpretation of brain images from older patients requires knowledge of changes that occur with healthy ageing. We constructed and tested a reference template for older subjects. We used MR images from normal subjects aged 65-70 and 75-80 to generate average age-specific images. We ranked the T2-weighted images by worsening brain tissue loss to create a diagram of key centiles. Two neuroradiologists tested the template during routine reporting; eight radiologists read 99 MR examinations without and then with the template. Fifty-four subjects (65-70 years) and 25 subjects (75-80 years) formed the reference images. For the two neuroradiologists, the reference template reduced the abnormal scan reporting from 28/42 without to 3/42 with the template. Of 99 MR examinations assessed by eight radiologists, 39/58 scans (67%) reported as moderate or severe atrophy without the template were reported as normal with the template (p=0.00011). Reference templates of the brain at older ages can "calibrate" radiology reporting. They could also be useful for research into ageing and related conditions. Larger numbers of examinations from more diverse populations and at different ages are required to increase the versatility of these templates.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The progression of neurodegenerative diseases as well as healthy aging is accompanied by structural changes of the brain. These changes are often only subtle when considered over time intervals of several months. Therefore morphometrical techniques for their detection in longitudinally acquired MR images must be highly sensitive, and they require a careful validation. In the present study, a novel processing chain for a longitudinal analysis based on deformation field morphometry is described. Procedures for its quantitative validation are also reported: Deformation fields were computed for the simulation of non-linear, local structural changes of human brains. Applying these deformation fields to "original" MR images yielded deformed MR images. The volume changes defined by the deformation fields represented the standard, against which the results of the longitudinal analysis of each pair of original and deformed MR image were compared. The proposed processing chain enabled to localize and to quantify simulated local atrophies near the cortex as well as in deep brain structures. An exemplary analysis of serial MR images of a patient suffering from an atypical Parkinson syndrome (cortico-basal degeneration, CBD) and healthy control subjects is presented, showing a characteristic pattern of volume changes in the brain of the patient which is strikingly different from the controls' patterns of changes.},

abstract={Objective To develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in individual subjects using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification of structural MR (sMR) images. Background Libraries of sMR scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects. Methods One hundred ninety patients with probable AD were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from sMR scans to give STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score; and Models II and III use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-score. Data from 140 AD and 140 CN were used for training. The SVM parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation (CV). The remaining independent sample of 50 AD and 50 CN was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm. Results The CV accuracy of Model II and Model III aSTAND-scores was 88.5% and 89.3%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary AD pathology. Conclusions This paper presents preliminary evidence that application of SVM-based classification of an individual sMR scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of AD. Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract={Simulated deformations and images can act as the gold standard for evaluating various template-based image segmentation and registration algorithms. Traditional deformable simulation methods, such as the use of analytic deformation fields or the displacement of landmarks followed by some form of interpolation, are often unable to construct rich (complex) and/or realistic deformations of anatomical organs. This paper presents new methods aiming to automatically simulate realistic inter- and intra-individual deformations. The paper first describes a statistical approach to capturing inter-individual variability of high-deformation fields from a number of examples (training samples). In this approach, Wavelet-Packet Transform (WPT) of the training deformations and their Jacobians, in conjunction with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial regularization, are used to capture both coarse and fine characteristics of the training deformations in a statistical fashion. Simulated deformations can then be constructed by randomly sampling the resultant statistical distribution in an unconstrained or a landmark-constrained fashion. The paper also describes a model for generating tissue atrophy or growth in order to simulate intra-individual brain deformations. Several sets of simulated deformation fields and respective images are generated, which can be used in the future for systematic and extensive validation studies of automated atlas-based segmentation and deformable registration methods. The code and simulated data are available through our Web site.},

abstract={Our goal was to determine the value of echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging in detecting the presence of primary acquired and residual cholesteatoma. One hundred patients were evaluated by preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The patient population consisted of a first group of 55 patients evaluated in order to detect the presence of a primary acquired cholesteatoma. In the second group, 45 patients were evaluated for the presence of a residual cholesteatoma 8-18 months after cholesteatoma surgery, prior to second-look surgery. Surgical findings were compared with preoperative findings on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of both groups was assessed. In the group of primary surgery patients, hyperintense signal compatible with cholesteatoma was found in 89% of cases with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for DWI of 81, 100, 100 and 40%, respectively. In the group of second-look surgery patients, only one of seven surgically verified residual cases was correctly diagnosed using DWI, with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 12.5, 100, 100 and 72%, respectively.

abstract={As population-based epidemiologic studies may acquire images from thousands of subjects, automated image post-processing is needed. However, error in these methods may be biased and related to subject characteristics relevant to the research question. Here, we compare two automated methods of brain extraction against manually segmented images and evaluate whether method accuracy is associated with subject demographic and health characteristics. MRI data (n = 296) are from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, a population-based study of elderly Japanese-American men. The intracranial space was manually outlined on the axial proton density sequence by a single operator. The brain was extracted automatically using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) and BSE (Brain Surface Extractor) on axial proton density images. Total intracranial volume was calculated for the manually segmented images (ticvM), the BET segmented images (ticvBET) and the BSE segmented images (ticvBSE). Mean ticvBSE was closer to that of ticvM, but ticvBET was more highly correlated with ticvM than ticvBSE. BSE had significant over (positive error) and underestimated (negative error) ticv, but net error was relatively low. BET had large positive and very low negative error. Method accuracy, measured in percent positive and negative error, varied slightly with age, head circumference, presence of the apolipoprotein estraight epsilon]4 polymorphism, subcortical and cortical infracts and enlarged ventricles. This epidemiologic approach to the assessment of potential bias in image post-processing tasks shows both skull-stripping programs performed well in this large image dataset when compared to manually segmented images. Although method accuracy was statistically associated with some subject characteristics, the extent of the misclassification (in terms of percent of brain volume) was small.},

abstract={Image registration integrates information from different imaging modalities and has the potential to improve determination of target volume in radiotherapy planning. This paper describes the implementation and validation of a 3D fully automated registration procedure in the process of radiotherapy treatment planning of brain tumors. Fifteen patients with various brain tumors received computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) brain imaging before the start of radiotherapy. First, the normalized mutual information (NMI) method was used for image registration. Registration accuracy was estimated by performing statistical analysis of coordinate differences between CT and MR anatomical landmarks along the x‐, y‐ and z‐axes. Second, a visual validation protocol was developed to validate the quality of individual registration solutions, and this protocol was tested in a series of 36 CT‐MR registration procedures with intentionally applied registration errors. The mean coordinate differences between CT and MR landmarks along the x‐ and y‐axes were in general within 0.5 mm. The mean coordinate differences along the z‐axis were within 1.0 mm, which is of the same magnitude as the applied slice thickness in scanning. In addition, the detection of intentionally applied registration errors by employment of a standardized visual validation protocol resulted in low false‐negative and low false‐positive rates. Application of the NMI method for the brain results in excellent automatic registration accuracy, and the method has been incorporated into the daily routine at our institution. A standardized validation protocol ensures the quality of individual registrations by detecting registration errors with high sensitivity and specificity. This protocol is proposed for the validation of other linear registration methods.PACS numbers: 87.53.Xd, 87.57.Gg},

abstract={Until now, patients with a shoulder instability being examined using magnetic resonance imaging have been placed in a position with the arm adducted or in the ABER position, as a result of the way conventional MR systems are built. Magnetic resonance systems with an open configuration have made it possible, for the first time, to examine patients in the apprehension-test position, which is a representative diagnostic position for anterior shoulder instability. This new examination position requires an exact understanding of layered imaging anatomy in order to clearly identify MR structures. The purpose of this study is to make possible a direct comparison of the respective abilities of MR cross-section imaging and thin-layer plastination to clearly identify all MR structures of the shoulder positioned in the apprehension-test position. The two shoulders of a body donor were separated and stored in special position supports in the apprehension-test position. The magnetic resonance examination was carried out using a vertically open 0.5-T MR system (Signa SP/i, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). The following sequences were used: 2D GRE, TR 42.5 ms, TE 20 ms, layer width 3 mm, matrix 512×512, FOV 24 cm. The coronary und transversal MR cross-section segments were subsequently planned in conjunction with thin-layer plastination for both shoulders. Using a direct comparison of MR images with the corresponding thin-layer plastination, it was possible to clearly identify all MR structures. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a central production facility with distribution network for implementation of hyperpolarized 3-helium MRI. The 3-helium was hyperpolarized to 50-65% using a large-scale production facility based at a university in Germany. Using a specially designed transport box, containing a permanent low-field shielded magnet and dedicated iron-free glass cells, the hyperpolarized 3-helium gas was transported via airfreight to a university in the UK. At this location, the gas was used to perform in vivo MR experiments in normal volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases. Following initial tests, the transport (road-air-road cargo) was successfully arranged on six occasions (approximately once per month). The duration of transport to imaging averaged 18 h (range 16-20 h), which was due mainly to organizational issues such as working times and flight connections. During the course of the project, polarization at imaging increased from 20% to more than 30%. A total of 4 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were imaged. The feasibility of a central production facility for hyperpolarized 3-helium was demonstrated. This should enable a wider distribution of gas for this novel technology without the need for local start-up costs.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The structural and functional integrity of the damper was maintained even with the simple layout of the damper. The dimensions of the MR valve are optimally determined by using finite element analysis. The damper performance under steady shear is experimentally evaluated with an INSTRON test machine. The test results showed that the prototype had fulfilled the basic requirements of the desired MR fluid steering damper.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate a velocity-encoded cine-MR (VEC-MR) sequence in measuring flow velocities up to two times the velocity encoding value (VENC) in a flow phantom and to validate the method for assessing poststenotic jet velocities in postoperative patients after aortic coarctation. In vitro, a flow phantom was used (0.5T; TR/TE: 51/8 ms, flip angle=30°, FOV=280 mm, 128×256 matrix VENC 40 or 80 cm/s). On binary images, maximum flow velocities (V^sub max^) were calculated with a region of interest (ROI, 8 pixels). With aliasing, V^sub max^ was calculated by VENC+(V^sub aliasing^). In vivo, 16 postoperative patients after aortic coarctation underwent double-oblique VEC-MR imaging through the aortic arch (ECG triggering, 16 phases/RR, TR=600-800 ms, flow-encoding cranio-caudal, VENC=2 m/s). Peak systolic velocities were measured and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) was performed. In vitro, there were excellent correlations for MR velocity measurements with and without aliasing (r=0.99) and for true and MR-derived flow velocities (r=0.99). In vivo, there was good correlation between VEC-MR and TTDE-assessed V^sub max^ values in the aorta at the former coarctation site (r=0.90, n=16). Aliasing occurred in 13 patients. VEC-MR is a useful modality for assessing jet velocities in the follow-up of patients after aortic coarctation. Despite of aliasing, accurate velocity measurements up to two times VENC are possible using binary images.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The goal of this research was to develop an automated algorithm for tracking the borders of the left ventricle (LV) in a cine-MRI gradient-echo temporal data set. The algorithm was validated on four patient populations: healthy volunteers and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or left ventricular aneurysm (LVA). A full tomographic set (approximately 11 slices/case) of short-axis images through systole was obtained for each patient. Initial endocardial and epicardial contours for the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) frames were manually traced on the computer by an experienced radiologist. The ED tracings were used as the starting point for the algorithm. The borders were tracked through each phase of the temporal data set, until the ES frame was reached (approximately 7 phases/slice). Peak gradients along equally spaced chords calculated perpendicular to a centerline determined midway between the endocardial and epicardial borders were used for border detection. This approach was tested by comparing the LV epicardial and endocardial volumes calculated at ES to those based on the manual tracings. The results of the algorithm compared favorably with both the endocardial (r2 = 0.72 - 0.98) and epicardial (r2 = 0.96 - 0.99) volumes of the tracer.},

abstract={Fully automatic co-registration of functional to anatomical brain images using information intrinsic to the scans has been validated in a clinical setting for positron emission tomography (PET), but not for single-photon emission tomography (SPET). In this paper we evaluate technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime to magnetic resonance (MR) co-registration for five fully automatic methods. We attached six small fiducial markers, visible in both SPET and MR, to the skin of 13 subjects. No increase in the radius of SPET acquisition was necessary. Distortion of the fiducial marker distribution observed in the SPET and MR studies was characterised by a measure independent of registration and three subjects were excluded on the basis of excessive distortion. The location of each fiducial marker was determined in each modality to sub-pixel precision and the inter-modality distance was averaged over all markers to give a fiducial registration error (FRE). The component of FRE excluding the variability inherent in the validation method was estimated by computing the error transformation between the arrays of MR marker locations and registered SPET marker locations. When applied to the fiducial marker locations this yielded the surface registration error (SRE), and when applied to a representative set of locations within the brain it yielded the intrinsic registration error (IRE). For the best method, mean IRE was 1.2 mm, SRE 1.5 mm and FRE 2.4 mm (with corresponding maxima of 3.3, 4.3 and 5.0 mm). All methods yielded a mean IRE <3 mm. The accuracy of the most accurate fully automatic SPET to MR co-registration was comparable with that published for PET to MR. With high standards of calibration and instrumentation, intra-subject cerebral SPET to MR registration accuracy of <2 mm is attainable.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The Resource Guide concedes that "in most classroom writing assignments, students follow a process that includes access to dictionaries, peer and teacher feedback and opportunities to revise and edit over time" (5), but that this "ondemand" series of writing tasks did not give students access to these customary resources, although time for self-editing could have been incorporated. Sadly, the Ontario Ministry of Education is using this highly 'inauthentic' assessment of Grade 9/10 writing to question the competency of both students and teachers. Not surprisingly, the failure rates are higher in rural Northern Ontario; in the Lakehead Schools (S. D. 157, Thunder Bay), for example, 29% failed writing as opposed to 24% provincially. As is the case with B.C.'s FSA, results reflect regional, linguistic, and socio-economic disparities rather than differences in the quality of teaching. For example, 44% of the Grade Tens in B. C. School District #57 (Prince George, a northern city the size of Thunder Bay with a resource-based economy, a college, and a small university) failed the composition on the FSA. Whereas the B.C. Ministry does not itself provide such district data (one must contact the individual districts for such information), in Ontario one may access such information from the website of the Education Quality Assessment Office (EQAO), suggesting that the general public is being invited to compare the performance of various school districts. As recently re-elected British Columbia Teachers' Federation President, David Chudnovsky, remarked in "Ranking Schools No Way to Improve Learning," spending millions of dollars merely to label learners and impute poor results to professional incompetency is no way to enhance classroom learning. Many in Ontario are already speculating as to whether the Ministry intends to retain failing students in Grade Ten, or whether these literacy and numeracy tests are merely precursors of a full-blown school-leaving assessment program akin to B.C.'s provincial examinations.},
