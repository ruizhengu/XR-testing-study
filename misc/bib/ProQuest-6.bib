abstract={Gait deficits are often persistent after stroke, and current rehabilitation methods do not restore normal gait for everyone. Targeted methods of focused gait therapy that meet the individual needs of each stroke survivor are needed. Our objective was to develop and test a combination protocol of simultaneous brain stimulation and focused stance phase training for people with chronic stroke (>6 months). We combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with targeted stance phase therapy using Virtual Reality (VR)-assisted treadmill training and overground practice. The training was guided by motor learning principles. Five users (>6 months post-stroke with stance phase gait deficits) completed 10 treatment sessions. Each session began with 30 min of VR-assisted treadmill training designed to apply motor learning (ML)-based stance phase targeted practice. During the first 15 min of the treadmill training, bihemispheric tDCS was simultaneously delivered. Immediately after, users completed 30 min of overground (ML)-based gait training. The outcomes included the feasibility of protocol administration, gait speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), paretic limb stance phase control capability, and the Fugl−Meyer for lower extremity coordination (FMLE). The changes in the outcome measures (except the assessments of stance phase control capability) were calculated as the difference from baseline. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed after 10 treatment sessions in gait speed (0.25 ± 0.11 m/s) and FGA (4.55 ± 3.08 points). Statistically significant improvements were observed in TUG (2.36 ± 3.81 s) and FMLE (4.08 ± 1.82 points). A 10-session intervention combining tDCS and ML-based task-specific gait rehabilitation was feasible and produced clinically meaningful improvements in lower limb function in people with chronic gait deficits after stroke. Because only five users tested the new protocol, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population. As a contribution to the field, we developed and tested a protocol combining brain stimulation and ML-based stance phase training for individuals with chronic stance phase deficits after stroke. The protocol was feasible to administer; statistically and/or clinically significant improvements in gait function across an array of gait performance measures were observed with this relatively short treatment protocol.},

abstract={Assessing the performance of human movements during teleoperation and virtual reality (VR) is a challenging problem, particularly in 3D space, due to complex settings. Despite the presence of a multitude of measurements, a compelling standardized 3D metric is yet missing, aggravating interstudy comparability. Hence, evaluating human performance in virtual environments (VEs) is a long-standing research goal, and a performance metric that combines two or more measurements under one formulation remains largely unexplored, particularly in higher dimensions. The absence of such a metric is primarily attributed to the discrepancies between pointing and manipulation, the complex spatial variables in 3D, and the combination of translational and rotational movements.},

abstract={On behalf of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) Quantitative MR Study Group, this article provides an overview of considerations for the development, validation, qualification, and dissemination of quantitative MR (qMR) methods. This process is framed in terms of two central technical performance properties, i.e., bias and precision. Although qMR is confounded by undesired effects, methods with low bias and high precision can be iteratively developed and validated. For illustration, two distinct qMR methods are discussed throughout the manuscript: quantification of liver proton‐density fat fraction, and cardiac T1. These examples demonstrate the expansion of qMR methods from research centers toward widespread clinical dissemination. The overall goal of this article is to provide trainees, researchers, and clinicians with essential guidelines for the development and validation of qMR methods, as well as an understanding of necessary steps and potential pitfalls for the dissemination of quantitative MR in research and in the clinic.},

abstract={Older pedestrians are at a high risk of becoming victims of car accidents because they tend not to pay sufficient attention to upcoming traffic. Within our research project, an assistance system for older pedestrians has been developed. It detects the street and communicates with the users through a vibrotactile interface. Two evaluation studies have been carried out in order to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of the developed assistance system. One study was conducted in a virtual environment (VR) with 23 participants, aged 65+. The other experiment was a field test in a real street environment with 26 participants, aged 65+. Objective dependent variables in both experiments were checking for traffic (operationalized via head tracking) and stopping in front of the street (VR study), i.e., approaching time (field test). Workload and acceptance served as subjective dependent variables. Analysis of the VR experiment showed significantly more head rotation with the assistance system than without it, as well as significantly more with cars than without cars. The same was true for the frequency of stopping. No significant difference was found concerning workload. With regard to acceptance, the majority of participants indicated that the system was supportive and able to reduce risks in traffic. In the field test, results for head rotation confirmed the findings of the VR study. Analysis showed a marginally significant higher head rotation frequency with the alarm system than without, and significantly different patterns of checking for traffic at marked and unmarked crossings. However, unlike in the VR study, no differences were found in approaching time with and without the assistance system. Approaching time was slower at marked crossings. No difference was found with regard to workload, meaning the use of the assistance system did not increase the subjectively perceived workload of participants. Analysis of the acceptance questionnaire showed a positive attachment to the assistance system. However, most reported that they did not experience any advantage from the use of the system, and expressed no intention to buy such a system for themselves.},

abstract={BackgroundThe triangle completion test has been used to assess egocentric wayfinding for decades, yet there is little information on its reliability. We developed a virtual reality (VR) based test and investigated whether either test of spatial navigation was reliable.ObjectiveTo examine test-retest reliability of the real-world and VR triangle completion tests. A secondary objective was to examine the usability of the VR based test.Materials and methodsThirty healthy adults aged 18-45 years were recruited to this block randomized study. Participants completed two sessions of triangle completion tests in the real-world and VR on the same day with a break between sessions.ResultsIn both test versions distance from the endpoint and angle of deviation showed poor test-retest reliability (r < 0.5). Distance traveled had moderate reliability in both the real-world and VR tests (r = 0.55 95% CI 0.23, 0.76]; r = 0.66 95% CI 0.4, 0.83, respectively]). The VR triangle test showed poor correlation with the real-world test.ConclusionThe triangle completion test has poor test-retest reliability and demonstrates poor concurrent validity between the real-world and VR. Nevertheless, it was feasible to translate a real-world test of spatial navigation into VR. VR provides opportunities for development of clinically relevant spatial navigation tests in the future.},

abstract={Nonequilibrium plasmas have been extensively investigated for polymer surface treatments in industrial applications. Plasma treatments can change the properties, such as electrical, chemical, tribological, biological, optical, and mechanical, which are easy to scale up to industrial applications. These can be extended to electronic industry. Consequently, light-emitting diode (LED) package was processed using Ar plasma at various flow rates and times. Thermal transient analysis showed reduced total thermal resistance (Formula Omitted]) and reduced rise in junction temperature (Formula Omitted]) for Ar plasma processed LED compared to the bare LED package data. Among the process parameters considered, 20-sccm flow of Ar gas exhibited better performance with respect to processing times. A noticeable reduction in Formula Omitted] value was recorded (Formula Omitted]) for Ar plasma processed LED from that of bare LED. Surface modification through cross linking was assumed by the Ar plasma process and supported to enhance the heat transfer through the modified surface of silicone encapsulation of the LED. In addition, the surface smoothness of silicone was induced by Ar plasma and helped to exhibit efficient heat transfer via convection. Based on the observed results, the Ar plasma process would be an effective postprocessing method for LED package to improve the performance as well as lifetime.},

abstract={Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign tumors of the vestibular nerve that may trigger hearing loss, tinnitus, rotatory vertigo, and dizziness in patients. Vestibular and auditory tests can determine the precise degree of impairment of the auditory nerve, and superior and inferior vestibular nerves. However, balance is often poorly quantified in patients with untreated vestibular schwannoma, for whom validated standardized assessments of balance are often lacking. Balance can be quantified with the EquiTest. However, this device was developed a long time ago and is expensive, specific, and not sensitive enough to detect early deficits because it assesses balance principally in the sagittal plane on a firm platform. In this study, we assessed postural performances in a well-defined group of VS patients. We used the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and a customized device consisting of a smartphone, a mask delivering a fixed or moving visual scene, and foam rubber. Patients were tested in four successive sessions of 25 s each: eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC), fixed visual scene (VR0), and visual moving scenes (VR1) delivered by the HTC VIVE mask. Postural oscillations were quantified with sensors from an android smartphone (Galaxy S9) fixed to the back. The results obtained were compared to those obtained with the EquiTest. Vestibulo-ocular deficits were also quantified with the caloric test and vHIT. The function of the utricle and saccule were assessed with ocular and cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (o-VEMPs and c-VEMPs), respectively. We found that falls and abnormal postural oscillations were frequently detected in the VS patients with the VR/Foam device. We detected no correlation between falls or abnormal postural movements and horizontal canal deficit or age. In conclusion, this new method provides a simpler, quicker, and cheaper method for quantifying balance. It will be very helpful for (1) determining balance deficits in VS patients; (2) optimizing the optimal therapy indications (active follow-up, surgery, or gamma therapy) and follow-up of VS patients before and after treatment; (3) developing new rehabilitation methods based on balance training in extreme conditions with disturbed visual and proprioceptive inputs.},

abstract={Fear and anxiety are generally assessed as responses of prey to high or low levels of threatening environments, fear-conditioned or unconditioned stimuli, or the intensity and distance between predator and prey. Depending on whether a threat is close to or distant from the individual, the individual exhibits specific behaviors, such as being quiet (freezing in animals) if the threat is distant or fleeing if the threat is close. In a seminal paper in 2007, Dean Mobbs developed an active prevention virtual reality paradigm (VRP) to study a threat's spatial imminence using finger shocks. In the present study, we used a modified VRP with a distinctive feature, namely a dynamic threat-of-loud noise paradigm. The results showed a significant reduction in the number of times the subjects were captured in the high predator phase (85 dB) vs. control phases, suggesting that the participants were motivated to avoid the high predator. Concomitant with avoidance behavior, a decrease in respiratory rate and an increase in heart rate characterized the defense reaction. These results demonstrate behavioral and autonomic effects of threat intensity in volunteers during a VRP, revealing a profile of defense reaction that reflects the individual emotional susceptibility to the development of anxiety.},

abstract={The visual depth perception is composed of monocular and binocular depth cues. Studies show that in absence of binocular depth cues the performance of visuomotor tasks like pointing to or grasping objects is limited. Thus, binocular depth cues are of great importance for motor control required in everyday life. However, binocular depth cues like retinal disparity (basis for stereopsis) might be influenced due to developmental disorders of the visual system. For example, amblyopia in which one eye's visual input is not processed leads to loss of stereopsis. The primary amblyopia treatment is occlusion of the healthy eye to force the amblyopic eye to train. However, improvements in stereopsis are poor. Therefore, binocular treatments arose that equilibrate both eyes' visual input to enable binocular vision. However, most approaches rely on divided stimuli which do not account for loss of stereopsis. We created a Virtual Reality (VR) with reduced monocular depth cues in which a stereoscopic task is shown to both eyes simultaneously, consisting of two balls jumping towards the user. One ball appears closer to the user which must be identified. To evaluate the task performance the reaction time is measured. We validated our approach with 18 participants with stereopsis under three contrast settings including one leading to monocular vision. The number of correct responses reduces from 90% under binocular vision to 52% under monocular vision corresponding to random guessing. Our results indicate that it is possible to disable monocular depth cues and create a dynamic stereoscopic task inside a VR.},

abstract={Although the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) constitutes a valid paradigm for social stress induction, less is known about the effects of a virtual reality (VR) TSST on short- and long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis responses. Hence, this study set out to evaluate reactivity and habituation of self-reported stress and HPA and SAM reactivity in a real TSST and VR-TSST when compared to a placebo TSST.Sixty-eight healthy young adults (50% female) were randomly assigned to either a real TSST, a VR-TSST, or a placebo TSST, all of which were conducted three times (one day and one week post initial exposure). Social presence, self-reported stress, salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed using ANOVAs and multilevel models.On the first exposure, both the real and VR-TSST showed significantly stronger cortisol and cardiovascular responses than the placebo. On the second visit, the cortisol response was still significantly high—and the HRV response low—for the real and VR-TSST. The third visit resulted in HR, HRV, and cortisol responses comparable to the placebo group. Furthermore, the real TSST induced more self-reported stress than the placebo on all three visits, the VR-TSST only on the first two visits. Social presence was stable across conditions and had no association with stress markers.These findings imply that the replicability of stress exposures at shorter intervals seems problematic for the traditional TSST, and for the VR-TSST.},

abstract={The graded exercise stress test (GEST) is used by the Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) to evaluate patient heart health and prescribe rehabilitative exercise. Understanding, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating the different pathological cardiac conditions during the GEST is important for exercise treatment. GEST training and assessments are typically conducted through live simulation experiences making it difficult to simulate actual high-risk clinical cases. Virtual reality (VR) provides a means of delivering reliable and immersive simulated experiences that can engage and enhance student learning. Ten AEPs were interviewed to identify current barriers to GEST training and assessment provision. Barriers were presented to a cohort of five experienced VR software developers who suggested VR platforms could work to effectively alleviate identified barriers. The findings indicate that the traditional GEST training model provides a solid foundation of understanding. However, there are limitations such as ensuring that the students experience all aspects of the task as well as the work with high acuity patients.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDAccurately measuring postural sway is an important part of balance assessment and rehabilitation. Although force plates give accurate measurements, their costs and space requirements make their use impractical in many situations.OBJECTIVEThe work presented in this paper aimed to address this issue by validating a virtual reality (VR) headset as a relatively low-cost alternative to force plates for postural sway measurement. The HTC Vive (HTC Corporation) VR headset has built-in sensors that allow for position and orientation tracking, making it a potentially eﬀective tool for balance assessments.METHODSParticipants in this study were asked to stand upright on a force plate (NeuroCom; Natus Medical Incorporated) while wearing the HTC Vive. Position data were collected from the headset and force plate simultaneously as participants experienced a custom-built VR environment that covered their entire field of view. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to examine the test-retest reliability of the postural control variables, which included the normalized path length, root mean square (RMS), and peak-to-peak (P2P) value. These were computed from the VR position output data and the center of pressure (COP) data from the force plate. Linear regression was used to investigate the correlations between the VR and force plate measurements.RESULTSOur results showed that the test-retest reliability of the RMS and P2P value of VR headset outputs (ICC: range 0.285-0.636) was similar to that of the RMS and P2P value of COP outputs (ICC: range 0.228-0.759). The linear regression between VR and COP measures showed significant correlations in RMSs and P2P values.CONCLUSIONSBased on our results, the VR headset has the potential to be used for postural control measurements. However, the further development of software and testing protocols for balance assessments is needed.},

abstract={Prior laboratory experiments among healthy samples found that training avoidance movements to angry faces may lower anger and aggression, especially people high in trait anger. To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, the present researchers developed it into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). The current study examined the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 30). In addition to the aggression replacement training, patients played either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Aggressive behavior was measured pre-, half-way, and post-treatment via self-report and clinicians ratings. No difference was found between the VR-GAIME and the control game. However, the participants reported gaining more insight into their own behavior and that of others. Future VR intervention tools in clinical settings may capitalize more on their benefits for self-reflection within interpersonal settings.},

abstract={The aim of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of using virtual reality to develop training modules for students who are participating in mechanical engineering laboratory classes. We investigated the feasibility of applying virtual reality and augmented reality technologies in manufacturing and material testing training programs to increase academic achievement, engagement, attitudes and self-efficacy toward engineering and also in fostering more effective use of expensive lab-equipment. We hypothesized that providing students with virtual reality and augmented reality enabled personalized manufacturing labs would increase students’ engagement and learning in this laboratory course. To validate the prototype and test our hypotheses, we conducted pilot testing at Texas A&M University. The total number of students with complete data analyzed for this study was 118. A two-group, randomized control group experiment was conducted. No significant differences were found for pre-existing factors including pretest and demographic factors. Five measures were administered to participants including subject matter measures and survey measures relating to attitudes, self-efficacy, engagement, and background demographics. Results of the pilot test data suggest an overall positive outcome for students participating in the virtual reality activity first (experimental condition) compared to those who performed physical machine activity first (control condition). Students who participated in the virtual reality activity first scored significantly higher on multiple-choice subject matter midtest scores. Analysis of open-ended subject matter responses indicates significantly higher gains for participants in the virtual reality activity compared to the physical activity. Subgroup analysis indicated a different performance pattern for female participants. Specifically, when pretest to midtest gain scores were analyzed, females in the experimental group gained twice as much over males after the virtual reality activity. Action data also revealed that female participants spent more time in the tutorial.},

abstract={Background A key clinical issue is how to maximise the belief change central to cognitive therapy. Physiological arousal is a key internal cue confirming threat beliefs in anxiety disorders. Deeper extinction of anxiety may occur if catastrophizing responses to physiological arousal are inhibited prior to joint exposure with external phobic stimuli. The aim of the study was to test whether increasing physiological arousal using exercise increases the benefits of behavioural tests. Methods Sixty individuals with a fear of heights had one session of VR cognitive treatment. They were randomised to have the treatment either with periods of intense physical exercise (cycling at 80% of maximum heart rate) prior to exposures or without. Linear mixed effects models were used to check the manipulation and test the primary hypothesis of a group difference in degree of conviction in the phobic threat belief. Results Heart rate was significantly higher in the exercise group throughout compared with the control group. Both groups showed significant reductions in threat beliefs after the VR treatment (d = 1.0, p < 0.001) but there was no significant group difference (d = 0.1, p = 0.56). Discussion An increase in physiological arousal achieved via exercise did not enhance cognitive change in beliefs about feared stimuli.},

abstract={The three types of presentations of ADHD often co-occur with other disorders, anxiety being one of the most prevalent. For this reason and because there are few studies that have examined the influence of anxiety on attentional activities, this study aims to determine how internalizing difficulties (anxiety levels) can influence performance in a virtual reality continuous performance test. The study used a non-probabilistic clinical sample comprising 68 boys (66%) and 35 girls (34%) aged between 6 and 16 (M = 12.24; SD = 2.45) who had been referred to clinical services for the evaluation of ADHD symptoms. Once informed consent was given, the children were administered the STAI-C scale and a virtual reality continuous performance test by expert researchers. Hierarchical regression models showed that only state anxiety demonstrated significant explanatory power over attentional variables. These findings confirm how important it is for children to feel relaxed when they undergo psychological evaluation tests, as otherwise the individual's intervention design would be based on biased data. Similarly, the findings also suggested an effect of IQ in the interpretation of continuous performance scores.},

abstract={The different pathways between the position of a near-infrared camera and the user's eye limit the use of existing near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems for tumor margin assessments. By utilizing an optical system that precisely matches the near-infrared fluorescence image and the optical path of visible light, we developed an augmented reality (AR)-based fluorescence imaging system that provides users with a fluorescence image that matches the real-field, without requiring any additional algorithms. Commercial smart glasses, dichroic beam splitters, mirrors, and custom near-infrared cameras were employed to develop the proposed system, and each mount was designed and utilized. After its performance was assessed in the laboratory, preclinical experiments involving tumor detection and lung lobectomy in mice and rabbits by using indocyanine green (ICG) were conducted. The results showed that the proposed system provided a stable image of fluorescence that matched the actual site. In addition, preclinical experiments confirmed that the proposed system could be used to detect tumors using ICG and evaluate lung lobectomies. The AR-based intraoperative smart goggle system could detect fluorescence images for tumor margin assessments in animal models, without disrupting the surgical workflow in an operating room. Additionally, it was confirmed that, even when the system itself was distorted when worn, the fluorescence image consistently matched the actual site.},

abstract={Virtual and augmented reality have seen increasing employment for teaching within medical and health sciences programs. For disciplines such as physiology and anatomy, these technologies may disrupt the traditional modes of teaching and content delivery. The objective of this systematic review and meta‐analysis is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality or augmented reality on knowledge acquisition for students studying preclinical physiology and anatomy. The protocol was submitted to Prospero and literature search undertaken in PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and other databases. Citations were reviewed and articles published in full assessing learning or knowledge acquisition in preclinical physiology and anatomy from virtual or augmented reality were included. Of the 919 records found, 58 eligible articles were reviewed in full‐text, with 8 studies meeting full eligibility requirements. There was no significant difference in knowledge scores from combining the eight studies (626 participants), with the pooled difference being a non‐significant increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI −2.9; 8.6]). For the four studies comparing virtual reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI −4.1; 15.7]). For the five studies comparing augmented reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.07 (95% CI −7.0; 7.2]). Upon review of the literature, it is apparent that educators could benefit from adopting assessment processes that evaluate three‐dimensional spatial understanding as a priority in physiology and anatomy. The overall evidence suggests that although test performance is not significantly enhanced with either mode, both virtual and augmented reality are viable alternatives to traditional methods of education in health sciences and medical courses.},

abstract={Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.},

abstract={New technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking software have paved the way for more sophisticated and ecologically valid measures of cognitive function. Testing the sensitivity and reliability of such measurements in response to acute alcohol intoxication provides a first step in establishing how these measures may operate in relation to cognitive impairments observed post-concussion. Healthy young adults (N = 54, M = 20.65, SD = 2.06, 30 females) completed the CONVIRT test battery (manual simple and choice reaction-time and saccade reaction-time) at three breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels: 0.00%T1, 0.05%T2, 0.08%T3. Participants consumed alcoholic beverages at 30-min intervals, with BrAC monitored at 15-min intervals using a breathalyser. All three CONVIRT measures were sensitive to changes in cognitive performance induced by alcohol at BrAC levels at or exceeding 0.05%. A composite measure was also sensitive to alcohol intoxication (Cohen’s d = .85 at BrAC = 0.05%; d = 1.20 at BrAC = 0.08%). Strong test–retest reliability was observed (all r < .80), with no gender differences noted. CONVIRT measures were reliable and detected dose-dependent changes in alcohol-induced cognitive impairment. Potentially, the ecologically valid measures may assist in better quantifying the effects of conditions such as concussion, on cognitive performance.},

abstract={Fear to contamination is an easy-to-provoke, intense, hard-to-control, and extraordinarily persistent fear. A worsening of preexisting psychiatric disorders was observed during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, and several studies suggest that those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be more affected than any other group of people. In the face of worsening OCD symptoms, there is a need for mental health professionals to provide the support needed not only to treat patients who still report symptoms, but also to improve relapse prevention. In this line, it is recommended to improve alternative strategies such as online consultations and digital psychiatry. The aim of this study is to develop augmented reality (AR) stimuli that are clinically relevant for patients with cleaning OCD and assess their efficiency to obtain emotionally significant responses. Four AR stimuli were developed: a plastic bag full of garbage, a piece of bread with mold, a dirty sports shoe, and a piece of rotten meat. All stimuli were shown to a clinical group (17 patients with cleaning OCD) and a control group (11 patients without OCD). Relevant results were the design of the AR stimuli. These stimuli were validated with the statistical difference in perceived anxiety in the meat stimuli between the clinical and control groups. Nevertheless, when looking at effect sizes, all stimuli present effect sizes from small (plastic bag) to large (meat), with both shoe and bread between small and medium effect sizes. These results are a valuable support for the clinical use of these AR stimuli in the treatment of cleaning OCD.},

abstract={Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of virtual reality as an effective teaching tool for motor training. Despite the growing interest in this field, only a few studies have determined the validity of the tasks made in virtual environments to real physical environments. This case-control study compares the score of pick and place activity in the real and virtual environment by using the box and blocks test setup on 4 able-bodied and 4 transradial amputees (2 myoelectric prosthetic users and 2 non-prosthetic users). This study integrates the traditional Box and Blocks Test mechanics into gameplay by using the Leap Motion controller and Oculus Rift headset. The participants were instructed to complete the test in both environments randomly for 10 sessions, with 30 minutes of training in each session. Pearson’s correlation interpretation was conducted to investigate the relation between the test’s score with the training duration, also the score obtained in the real and virtual environment. Independent samples t-test was also carried out to compare the score from the different test environments. All participants showed a greater percentage change of test score in the virtual version and better performance was achieved with increasing training duration. Both environments were positively correlated. However, there was a significant difference in the test score obtained in the real and virtual environment for able-bodied t(9) = 18.19, p < 0.05 and myoelectric prosthetic user t(9) = 4.51, p},

abstract={Mirror therapy (MT) has been proposed as an essential component of upper limb neuro-rehabilitation, using mirror illusion of the unaffected hand movement and superimposing it on the affected hand to improve neuroplasticity for improving motor recovery in stroke patients. In this paper, we developed a virtual reality mirror therapy (VRMT) system, and examined the performance of the proposed VRMT system. The VRMT system consists of a motion-tracking device, a VR goggle, and a VRMT software. Young, healthy participants, and stroke patients with mild-to-severe hemiparesis were recruited in this study, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed VRMT system. Experimental results based on the pinch-holding-up activity (PHUA) test revealed a significant effect on the precision pinch performance of young-healthy participants receiving VRMT, whereas traditional MT could not improve the precision pinch performance in young-healthy participants (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Formula Omitted], Formula Omitted]). For patients having suffered a stroke and being treated with VRMT, significant beneficial effects examined by mixed effect model were found on the total score of FMA (Formula Omitted]) and hand part of FMA (Formula Omitted]). The findings in this study indicate that the VRMT system has a potentially positive effects on the sensorimotor performance of hands in healthy participants. In addition, add-on effect of VR to MT provides beneficial effects on motor function of the upper extremity in chronic stroke patients.},

abstract={As the global population ages, the incidence of major neurocognitive disorders (major NCDs), such as the most common geriatric major NCD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), has grown. Thus, the need for more definitive cognitive assessment or even effective non-pharmacological intervention for age-related NCDs is becoming more and more pressing given that no definitive diagnostics or efficacious therapeutics are currently unavailable for them. We evaluate the current state of the art of cognitive assessment for major NCDs, and then briefly glance ahead at potential application of virtual reality (VR) technologies in major NCD assessment and in cognition training of visuospatial reasoning in a 3D environment, as well as in the alleviation of depression and other symptoms of cognitive disorders. We believe that VR-based technologies have tremendous potentials in cognitive assessment and non-pharmacological therapy for major NCDs.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) allows for the creation of ecological environments that could be used for cognitive assessment and intervention. This study comprises two parts that describe and assess an immersive VR task, the Virtual Shop, which can be used to measure episodic memory. Part 1 addresses its applicability in healthy older adults by measuring presence, motivation, and cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task, and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in the Virtual Shop, in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence, higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task, and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups, and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus, the use of VR is feasible in older adults and the Virtual Shop is a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to compare the effect of digital (i.e., augmented reality AR]) and live demonstrations of two fundamental motor skills. The motor skills were horizontal jump and over-the-shoulder throw with performance criteria described in the Test of Gross Motor Development—Second Edition (TGMD-2). We developed a digital model using AR installed on a tablet computer compatible with the Android operating system. We recruited 131 children and assigned them to three age groups: G1, 3-5 years old (M = 4.25, SD = 0.71 years); G2, 6-8 years old (M = 7.16, SD = 0.79 years); and G3, 9-11 years old (M =10.13, SD= 0.84 years). Randomly, half of the children in each group performed the two motor skills after watching either the AR or the live demonstrations; seven days later, all children repeated the motor skills with the demonstration type inverted. We applied Wilcoxon’s test with statistical significance set at p < .05 and found no significant performance differences based on demonstration exposure from AR versus live modeling. We propose that AR technology is a potential tool for demonstrating human movement.},

abstract={In general chemistry laboratories, students learn practical laboratory skills through hands-on activities and are exposed to new scientific instruments. However, these instruments are often viewed as black boxes for various reasons, where students do not know how to use them or what the instruments are capable of. This tendency is likely to induce some measure of fear in the students' attitude toward learning about instruments, even though instrumentation is a significant part of laboratory education. Augmented reality in educational laboratory (ARiEL) is an application utilizing AR technology designed to connect students to information on scientific instruments. ARiEL can be downloaded and used on phones or tablets while students are working on experiments, providing them with direct and immediate forms of information about laboratory instruments. Currently, the pH meter and conductivity meter are two instruments ARiEL can recognize as they are small, benchtop devices often used in general chemistry laboratory courses. An initial usability study with a focus group of first-term general chemistry students indicated that the application is not only easy to use but also preferred over a common search engine when looking for information on specific instruments. The application was used in a second-term general chemistry laboratory course and tested for usability evaluation and to measure students' attitude toward chemistry instrumentation. The results suggest that the availability of ARiEL helps to reduce anxiety associated with using instruments and to improve intellectual accessibility.},

abstract={The psychological effects of information technology (IT) use have been widely reported and assessed in the literature. However, although concerns are growing regarding the potential physiological impacts of IT use on the health of IT users, assessment of this issue is currently hampered by the lack of an appropriate information-system (IS) physiological scale. Given the limited utility of existing self-report instruments, the main purpose of this study is to develop an instrument to measure perceived physiological vulnerability to IT use (PPVITU). This study introduces and defines a PPVITU construct, validates this construct and its basic dimensions empirically, develops a generic PPVITU instrument with appropriate psychometric properties, and examines the theoretical and practical applications of this instrument. After analyzing data provided by 308 IT-user respondents, this study proposes a 4-factor, 17-item PPVITU instrument. The authors expect that this empirically validated instrument will be useful to researchers working to develop and test theories of educational technology use as well as to educators working to better understand student perceptions of physiological vulnerability to IT and educational-technology use.},

abstract={With the ultimate aim of early diagnosis of dementia, a new body balance assessment system with integrated head-mounted display-based virtual reality (VR) has been developed. We hypothesized that people would sway more in anterior-posterior (AP) direction when they were exposed to a VR environment where we intentionally provoked movements in forward and backward directions. A total of 14 healthy older adults (OA) (73.14±4.26 years) and 15 healthy young adults (YA) (24.93±1.49 years) were assessed for group differences in sway behavior. Body sway speed in 22 different conditions with and without VR environments was analyzed. Significant differences and large effect sizes were observed in AP sway under the VR environments (OA with P 0.61, YA with P 0.72) compared to the baseline condition without the VR environments. In addition, significant differences were found between the two groups in AP sway in all test conditions (P < 0.01). Our study shows that a VR environment can trigger body sway in an expected direction, which may indicate that it is possible to enhance the sensitivity of balance assessment by integrating immersive VR environments. The result of this study warrants a cross-sectional study in which OA diagnosed with and without dementia are compared on their sway behavior.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEThe aim of this study is to assess whether distraction (lack of attentional focus) and attention (cognitive load) are differentially involved in the analgesic effect of virtual reality (VR) immersions during a cold pressor test (CPT).METHODSThirty-one participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (high and low cognitive load, attention with or without a reminder of the pain stimuli) and performed three CPTs. Pain was assessed based on the duration of the CPT (pain tolerance), a visual analog rating scale of perceived pain intensity during the CPT and the subjective pain scale of the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).RESULTSThe statistical analyses revealed that VR immersions were associated with less pain compared to the baseline (all p <0.001), but for the experimental manipulations, only the conditions where there was an increase in cognitive load (ie, from low cognitive load at Immersion 1 to high cognitive load at Immersion 2) were effective for increasing pain tolerance (significant Time X Conditions interaction). The interactions were not significant for pain intensity assessed with the VAS or the SF-MPQ.CONCLUSIONThe results suggest that increases in cognitive load play an important role in the analgesic effect of VR immersion, although the combination of attentional focus and cognitive load may be important. Suggestions are given for designing a replication study.},

abstract={Motivation to learn is an important component of education, particularly in the field of educational technology in which the instructor's physical presence is increasingly absent. The complexity of the many factors that contribute to student motivation renders this domain difficult to measure. The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) instrument was created to measure and identify issues related to student motivation within the use of self-directed learning materials. The IMMS was designed to measure the degree to which the learner becomes engaged in the learning experience through elements of attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS). Since its creation, several academic studies have made use of the IMMS to assess student motivation, however these studies demonstrate a lack of consensus on the validity and reliability of the instrument. This study examined the validity and reliability of the IMMS as measured by baccalaureate nursing students who completed the IMMS survey instrument following a clinical training simulation. Validation of the survey data retained 19 IMMS items distributed across all four ARCS subscales. The findings reported extend previous validation evidence by validating the instrument with mixed reality instructional simulation. These findings demonstrate the agnostic nature of the IMMS instrument with regard to instructional delivery medium.},

abstract={Most research groups studying human navigational behavior with virtual environment (VE) technology develop their own tasks and protocols. This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools—for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely.},

abstract={Despite the persistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) into adulthood and adolescence, there are few objective, reliable instruments (based on patient performance) that have been shown to be able to predict current and retrospective ADHD symptoms. The present study aimed to explore whether a validated VR test called Nesplora Aquarium is able to predict ADHD symptoms in adults and adolescents, based on both current and retrospective self-reports. A non-clinical sample of 156 adults and adolescents (70 women and 86 men) between 16 and 54 years of age (M = 21.23, SD = 8.04) took part in the study. Virtual reality (VR) variables such as the number of correct answers, omission and commission errors, among others, were used to predict current and retrospective self-reported symptoms of ADHD using multiple regression models. Correct answers and omission errors in the VR test significantly predicted both current and retrospective ADHD symptoms. However, only the number of perseveration errors and gender were able to significantly predict retrospective ADHD symptoms. These findings suggest that inattention problems tend to remain after adolescence, while perseveration errors (which have been related to impulsive behavior) and gender differences tend to diminish.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, mainstream technology. VR technology is superambulatory as it allows participants to be examined under standardized environments and tests anywhere. In addition, it can test participants in different virtual spaces, including environments that are unsafe, inaccessible, costly or difficult to set up, or even nonexistent. We summarize the benefits and potential problems of VR technology, but we also move beyond theoretical approaches and present a customizable, open-source VR system (PSY-VR) that allows scalable psychological testing in modifiable VR environments. This system allows users to modify the environment using a simple graphical interface, without programming expertise. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, we compare responses in a typical Flanker task between a real laboratory and a painstakingly matched virtual laboratory. Results indicate that the VR responses are comparable to real life testing, demonstrating the utility of VR for psychological assessment studies. The predicted rapid advancement of VR immersive technologies, as well the ease of their integration with physiological metrics ensures that VR-based assessment will be the modus operandi of psychological assessment in the future. This will allow controllable, low-cost assessment on a global scale.},

We studied how immersive three-dimensional (3-D) virtual reality environments may augment and advance the evaluation of safety-critical nuclear power plant CR systems. A multiuser functionality enables several operators to be located and to collaborate in the same virtual CR environment at the same time. There is also a realistic representation of emergency operating procedures in the virtual CR. Spatial audio communication through headsets makes the experience even more realistic. The paper addresses both technical and human factors issues associated with the use of immersive 3-D virtual reality environments in CR validation tests, for example, the amount of technical resources required as compared to normal validation in a real-life physical simulator environment, creation of methodologically new testing opportunities, and new opportunities for data registration and analysis. A new framework has been established for estimating the needed fidelity level of the virtual CR for the type of system evaluation at hand.},

In this study, a novel kind of composite iron particle—graphene oxide (GO)-coated magnetic particles was adopted to prepare MR fluids together with surfactants-modified iron particles. The influence of dosage proportions of the two composite iron particles, volume fraction of iron particles, and the dosage of liquid paraffin on the performances of MR fluids was investigated through sedimentation stability, viscosity, and shear yield stress tests. The test results presented that GO-coated iron particles with low density and high-saturation magnetization were beneficial to the improvement of stability and adjustability. Additionally, dosage proportions of the two composite iron particles, volume fraction of iron particles, and the dosage of liquid paraffin all had significant influence on the performances of MR fluids. Finally, the mathematical model of shear yield stress of the MR fluid was deduced, and the calculated results were compared with the tested data, which had verified the correctness of the mathematical model.},

abstract={We examine the influence of street scales (the street width, building height, and street-width-to-building-height ratio, referred to as `width-to-height ratio' in the paper) on visual, acoustic, and audio-visual comfort evaluation (as evaluated by a set of participants) in urban areas. In addition, we examine the relationships between the sound level and the abovementioned subjective comfort evaluation except the visual one. After measuring the street scales and recording the street visual information with a 3D camcorder, the virtual 3D models of the streets were generated. Meanwhile, dual-channel acoustic signals of the streets were collected. Subsequently, subjective tests were carried out using a 3D virtual reality with corresponding sounds using 164 participants. The analysis shows that subjective attitudes are directly related to the street scales. In particular, there is a strong positive correlation between audio-visual comfort and the street width-to-height ratio. In contrast, the three indicators (visual, acoustic, and audio-visual comfort) are strongly negatively correlated to the height, and this type of negative correlation is also observed between subjective indicators (except the visual one) and the sound level. Overall, the respondents found the audio-visual level most comfortable when the street width-to-height ratio is greater than 1, street width is within 20 m, height of street buildings is less than 26 m, and the sound level is less than 58 dBA. It is expected that these findings can aid designers in predicting the ideal audio-visual environment quality for urban streets.},

abstract={In the field of spatial cognition research the mutual relationship between perception and action that brings out spatial orientation was lately investigated. Besides, the sameness between creating a cognitive map from the exploration of a not simulated environment, from the use of an allocentric (survey-like) sketched map, and from the interaction with egocentric (route-like) 3D virtual environments, is generally contrived. To understand if different embodied affordances could provide different knowledge organization during wayfinding through the use of distinct spatial simulations, the same group of 61 healthy subjects experienced both the classical version of the Money's Road Map test (M-RMT) and a virtual reality version of the Road Map test (VR-RMT). The M-RMT requires a allocentric to egocentric right/left reasoning to explore a stylized city provided in a survey perspective. The VR-RMT is a 3D version of the same environment through which participants can actively navigate by choosing egocentric-based right/left directions in a route perspective. The results showed that the different embodiments afforded by the two environments and the increasing complexity in turn types provides different spatial outcomes. Results were discussed according to the sensorimotor coupling theory provided from the enactive cognition approach and significances for spatial cognition research were provided.},

abstract={Myocardial blood flow (MBF) is the critical determinant of cardiac function. However, its response to increases in partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2), particularly with respect to adenosine, is not well characterized because of challenges in blood gas control and limited availability of validated approaches to ascertain MBF in vivo. Methods: By prospectively and independently controlling PaCO2 and combining it with 13N-ammonia PET measurements, we investigated whether a physiologically tolerable hypercapnic stimulus (~25 mm Hg increase in PaCO2) can increase MBF to that observed with adenosine in 3 groups of canines: without coronary stenosis, subjected to non-flow-limiting coronary stenosis, and after preadministration of caffeine. The extent of effect on MBF due to hypercapnia was compared with adenosine. Results: In the absence of stenosis, mean MBF under hypercapnia was 2.1 ± 0.9 mL/min/g and adenosine was 2.2 ± 1.1 mL/min/g; these were significantly higher than at rest (0.9 ± 0.5 mL/min/g, P < 0.05) and were not different from each other (P = 0.30). Under left-anterior descending coronary stenosis, MBF increased in response to hypercapnia and adenosine (P < 0.05, all territories), but the effect was significantly lower than in the left-anterior descending coronary territory (with hypercapnia and adenosine; both P < 0.05). Mean perfusion defect volumes measured with adenosine and hypercapnia were significantly correlated (R = 0.85) and were not different (P = 0.12). After preadministration of caffeine, a known inhibitor of adenosine, resting MBF decreased; and hypercapnia increased MBF but not adenosine (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Arterial blood CO2 tension when increased by 25 mm Hg can induce MBF to the same level as a standard dose of adenosine. Prospectively targeted arterial CO2 has the capability to evolve as an alternative to current pharmacologic vasodilators used for cardiac stress testing.},

abstract={To assess the construct and face validity of ArthroS, a passive haptic VR simulator. A secondary aim was to evaluate the novel performance metrics produced by this simulator. Two groups of 30 participants, each divided into novice, intermediate or expert based on arthroscopic experience, completed three separate tasks on either the knee or shoulder module of the simulator. Performance was recorded using 12 automatically generated performance metrics and video footage of the arthroscopic procedures. The videos were blindly assessed using a validated global rating scale (GRS). Participants completed a survey about the simulator's realism and training utility. This new simulator demonstrated construct validity of its tasks when evaluated against a GRS (p less than or equal to 0.003 in all cases). Regarding it's automatically generated performance metrics, established outputs such as time taken (p less than or equal to 0.001) and instrument path length (p less than or equal to 0.007) also demonstrated good construct validity. However, two-thirds of the proposed 'novel metrics' the simulator reports could not distinguish participants based on arthroscopic experience. Face validity assessment rated the simulator as a realistic and useful tool for trainees, but the passive haptic feedback (a key feature of this simulator) is rated as less realistic. The ArthroS simulator has good task construct validity based on established objective outputs, but some of the novel performance metrics could not distinguish between surgical experience. The passive haptic feedback of the simulator also needs improvement. If simulators could offer automated and validated performance feedback, this would facilitate improvements in the delivery of training by allowing trainees to practise and self-assess.},

abstract={"Forgiveness" - the difference between a drug's postdose duration of action and its prescribed dosing interval - estimates the margin of therapeutic effect following a missed dose. Because this margin presumably decreases as dosing becomes less frequent, QD dosing of an antiepileptic drug (AED) is expected to be less forgiving than more frequent (e.g., BID) dosing of that same AED. However, if the AED is reformulated as an extended-release (XR) preparation, drug input may be prolonged relative to its immediate-release (IR) counterpart. It therefore stands to reason that forgiveness could be increased by an XR AED that extends the period during which therapeutic plasma concentrations are maintained if a dose is missed. Computer simulation was used to estimate forgiveness for an IR formulation of a hypothetical AED and its XR counterparts reformulated for less frequent dosing. Simulations determined forgiveness when the hypothetical IR AED was dosed TID, BID, and QD and when suitably designed XR formulations were dosed BID and QD. Simulations showed that forgiveness for an XR formulation can equal or exceed that for an IR formulation dosed more frequently.},

abstract={Purpose: Virtual reality simulator training has become important for acquiring arthroscopic skills. A new simulator for knee arthroscopy ArthroS(TM) has been developed. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate face and construct validity, executed according to a protocol used previously to validate arthroscopic simulators. Methods: Twenty-seven participants were divided into three groups having different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants answered questions regarding general information and the outer appearance of the simulator for face validity. Construct validity was assessed with one standardized navigation task. Face validity, educational value and user friendliness were further determined by giving participants three exercises and by asking them to fill out the questionnaire. Results: Construct validity was demonstrated between experts and beginners. Median task times were not significantly different for all repetitions between novices and intermediates, and between intermediates and experts. Median face validity was 8.3 for the outer appearance, 6.5 for the intra-articular joint and 4.7 for surgical instruments. Educational value and user friendliness were perceived as nonsatisfactory, especially because of the lack of tactile feedback. Conclusion: The ArthroS(TM) demonstrated construct validity between novices and experts, but did not demonstrate full face validity. Future improvements should be mainly focused on the development of tactile feedback. It is necessary that a newly presented simulator is validated to prove it actually contributes to proficiency of skills.},

abstract={Background:Diagnostic knee arthroscopy is a common procedure that orthopaedic residents are expected to learn early in their training. Arthroscopy requires a different skill set from traditional open surgery, and many orthopaedic residents feel less prepared for arthroscopic procedures. Virtual reality simulation training and testing provide an opportunity to ensure basic competency before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients.Methods:Twenty-six physicians (thirteen novices and thirteen experienced arthroscopic surgeons) were voluntarily recruited to perform a test consisting of five arthroscopic procedures on a knee arthroscopy simulator. Performance was evaluated by obtaining predefined metrics from the simulator for each procedure, and z-scores, describing suboptimal performance, were calculated from the metrics. The intercase reliability of the simulator metrics was explored by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient. Finally, a pass-or-fail standard was set with use of the contrasting groups method, and the consequences of the pass-or-fail standard were explored.Results:One procedure was excluded from the final test because of a lack of validity. The total Z-scores for the four procedures included in the final test showed an intercase reliability of 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.93). The total mean z-score (and standard deviation) was 38.6 plus or minus 27.3 points for the novices and 0.0 plus or minus 9.1 points for the experienced surgeons (p < 0.0005). The pass-or-fail standard was set at a total z-score of 15.5 points, resulting in two of the novices passing the test and a single experienced surgeon failing the test.Conclusions:By combining four procedures on a virtual reality arthroscopy simulator, it was possible to create a valid, reliable, and feasible test of basic arthroscopic competency and to establish a credible pass-or-fail standard.Clinical Relevance:The simulation-based test and pass-or-fail standard could aid in assessing and ensuring basic competency of future orthopaedic residents before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients.},

abstract={Objective: To determine the criterion and content validity of a virtual reality (VR) balance module for use in clinical practice. Design: Retrospective, VR balance module completed by participants during concussion baseline or assessment testing session. Setting: A Pennsylvania State University research laboratory. Participants: A total of 60 control and 28 concussed students and athletes from the Pennsylvania State University. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: This study examined: (1) the relationship between VR composite balance scores (final, stationary, yaw, pitch, and roll) and area of the center-of-pressure (eyes open and closed) scores and (2) group differences (normal volunteers and concussed student-athletes) on VR composite balance scores. Results: With the exception of the stationary composite score, all other VR balance composite scores were significantly correlated with the center of pressure data obtained from a force platform. Significant correlations ranged from r = -0.273 to -0.704 for the eyes open conditions and from r = -0.353 to -0.876 for the eyes closed condition. When examining group differences on the VR balance composite modules, the concussed group did significantly (P < 0.01) worse on all measures compared with the control group. Conclusions: The VR balance module met or exceeded the criterion and content validity standard set by the current balance tools and may be appropriate for use in a clinical concussion setting. Clinical Relevance: Virtual reality balance module is a valid tool for concussion assessment in clinical settings. This novel type of balance assessment may be more sensitive to concussion diagnoses, especially later (7-10 days) in the recovery phase than current clinical balance tools.},

abstract={Purpose To design and validate a desktop virtual reality (VR) system, for presentation and assessment of volumetric data, based on commercially off-the-shelf hardware as an alternative to a fully immersive CAVE-like I-Space VR system. Methods We designed a desktop VR system, using a three-dimensional (3D) monitor and a six degrees-of-freedom tracking system. A personal computer uses the V-Scope (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) volume-rendering application, developed for the I-Space, to create a hologram of volumetric data. Inter- and intraobserver reliability for crown-rump length and embryonic volume measurements are investigated using Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. Time required for the measurements was recorded. Results Comparing the I-Space and the desktop VR system, the mean difference for crown-rump length is -0.34% (limits of agreement -2.58-1.89, plus or minus 2.24%) and for embryonic volume -0.92% (limits of agreement -6.97-5.13, plus or minus 6.05%). Intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients of the desktop VR system were all >0.99. Measurement times were longer on the desktop VR system compared with the I-Space, but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions A user-friendly desktop VR system can be put together using commercially off-the-shelf hardware at an acceptable price. This system provides a valid and reliable method for embryonic length and volume measurements and can be used in clinical practice. copyright 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={To help avoiding secondary effects of interventional procedures like skin damage, a dose map method has been developed to provide an indication of the local dose on a surface representative of individual patient shapes. To minimise user interactions, patient envelope shapes are automatically determined depending on simple patient data information. Local doses are calculated in 1-cm super(2) areas depending on the estimated air kerma, table and gantry positions and system settings, taking into account the table and mattress attenuations and estimated backscatter from the patient. These local doses are cumulated for each location of the patient envelope during the clinical procedure. To assess the accuracy of the method, Gafchromic XR-RV3 films have been used in several operating configurations. Good visual agreements on cumulated dose localisation were obtained within the 1-cm super(2) precision of the map and the dose values agreed within 24.9 % accuracy. The resulting dose map method has been integrated into GE Healthcare X-Ray angiographic systems and should help in the management of the dose by the users during the procedure.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and concurrent validity of commonly used physical performance tests using the OmniVR(TM) Virtual Rehabilitation System for healthy community-dwelling elders. Method: Participants (N = 40) were recruited by the authors and were screened for eligibility. The initial method of measurement was randomized to either virtual reality (VR) or clinically based measures (CM). Physical performance tests included the five times sit to stand, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Forward Functional Reach (FFR) and 30-s stand test A random number generator determined the testing order. The test-re-test reliability for the VR and CM was determined. Furthermore, concurrent validity was determined using a Pearson product moment correlation (Pearson r). Results: The VR demonstrated excellent reliability for 5 x STS intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.931 sub((3,1)), FFR ICC = 0.846 sub((3,1)) and the TUG ICC =0 .944 sub((3,1)) The concurrent validity data for the VR and CM (ICC 3, k) were moderate for FFR ICC = 0.682, excellent 5 x STS ICC = 0.889 and excellent for the TUG ICC = 0.878. The concurrent validity of the 30-s stand test was good ICC = 0.735 sub((3,1)), Conclusions: This study supports the use of VR equipment for measuring physical performance tests in the clinic for healthy community-dwelling elders.},

abstract={Introduction: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions (EFs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups. Materials and methods: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of EFs. Results: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients vs. the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of EFs (neuropsychological battery). Conclusion: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of EFs is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.},

abstract={The use of virtual reality for the provision of motor-cognitive gait training has been shown to be effective for a variety of patient populations. The interaction between the user and the virtual environment is achieved by tracking the motion of the body parts and replicating it in the virtual environment in real time. In this paper, we present the validation of a novel method for tracking foot position and orientation in real time, based on the Microsoft Kinect technology, to be used for gait training combined with virtual reality. The validation of the motion tracking method was performed by comparing the tracking performance of the new system against a stereo-photogrammetric system used as gold standard. Foot position errors were in the order of a few millimeters (average Formula Omitted] from 4.9 to 12.1 mm in the medio-lateral and vertical directions, from 19.4 to 26.5 mm in the anterior-posterior direction); the foot orientation errors were also small (average Formula Omitted] from 5.6% to 8.8% in the medio-lateral and vertical directions, from 15.5% to 18.6% in the anterior-posterior direction). The results suggest that the proposed method can be effectively used to track feet motion in virtual reality and treadmill-based gait training programs.},

abstract={The spore-pollen zonation developed for the Gippsland Basin, southeast Australia, is widely used to date Paleogene-Neogene terrestrial sediments elsewhere in Australia. Microfloras preserved in an argon-40 ( super(40)Ar)/argon-39 ( super(39)Ar) dated 23 Ma claystone on the summit of the Great Dividing Range at Toowoomba in subtropical southeast Queensland indicate the Gippsland zonation, and the parallel schemata developed for the epicontinental Murray Basin in southeastern Australia provide only a general guide to the age of Late Paleogene-Neogene sediments as far north as Queensland. The finding reiterates the need to develop regional spore-pollen palynostratigraphies for Queensland (and northern Australia) centred on Cenozoic microfloras whose geologic age can be independently verified by other dating techniques. The same microfloras, however, are reliable evidence of past vegetation and climates, in this instance that a form of Nothofagus-gymnosperm temperate rainforest was colonising basaltic soils at Toowoomba during the Oligo-Miocene transition when southeast Queensland was located c. 15 degree south of its present latitudial position.},

abstract={Background: Virtual reality (VR) is not commonly used in clinical rehabilitation, and commercial VR gaming systems may have mixed effects in patients with stroke. Therefore, we developed RehabMaster(TM), a task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and clinical efficacy. Methods: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects, and drop-out rate were recorded. Results: The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (P = .03) and MBI (P = .04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement in the FMA (P = .07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI. One patient with chronic stroke left the trial, and no adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: The RehabMaster is a feasible and safe VR system for enhancing upper extremity function in patients with stroke.},

abstract={Automated perimetry is used for the assessment of visual function in a variety of ophthalmic and neurologic diseases. We report development and clinical testing of a compact, head-mounted, and eye-tracking perimeter (VirtualEye) that provides a more comfortable test environment than the standard instrumentation. VirtualEye performs the equivalent of a full threshold 24-2 visual field in two modes: (1) manual, with patient response registered with a mouse click, and (2) visual grasp, where the eye tracker senses change in gaze direction as evidence of target acquisition. 59 patients successfully completed the test in manual mode and 40 in visual grasp mode, with 59 undergoing the standard Humphrey field analyzer (HFA) testing. Large visual field defects were reliably detected by VirtualEye. Point-by-point comparison between the results obtained with the different modalities indicates: (1) minimal systematic differences between measurements taken in visual grasp and manual modes, (2) the average standard deviation of the difference distributions of about 5 dB, and (3) a systematic shift (of 4-6 dB) to lower sensitivities for VirtualEye device, observed mostly in high dB range. The usability survey suggested patients' acceptance of the head-mounted device. The study appears to validate the concepts of a head-mounted perimeter and the visual grasp mode.},

abstract={The experiment presented provides partial cross-cultural empirical support for Pascal Boyer's theory of the transmission of minimally counterintuitive (MCI) ideas. Boyer hypothesized that concepts with a small number of counterintuitive features are better remembered and more faithfully communicated than extremely counterintuitive concepts or comparable ordinary or even unusual concepts. This transmission advantage may help to explain the cross-cultural ubiquity of religious/supernatural concepts, which often have counterintuitive features. The experiment was conducted in Second Life, an online 3D virtual world. Fifty English-speaking western participants and 51 Chinese-speaking participants from far-eastern nations viewed intuitive and counterintuitive test items and then were asked to free recall the displays immediately and after varying delays. Results show that MCI displays were not better recalled than intuitive displays at initial reporting. For both samples, however, the amount of time elapsed since exposure to the test items correlated significantly with memory degradation for intuitive concepts but not for counterintuitive concepts. These results suggest that although MCI concepts may not be more easily encoded than intuitive concepts, once they are encoded they may be more easily retrieved than intuitive concepts. Results also show that, among the westerners, increased age predicted poorer delayed recall of MCI but not intuitive items, suggesting that the MCI effect may bear most directly on transmitting ideas to adolescents and young adults.

abstract={The assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a difficult challenge for the DoD medical health system. Clinical neuropsychologists are being asked to make statements regarding a soldier's functional skills, ability to return to active duty, and competence in tasks of community living. Given the increasing prevalence of blast injuries to the head, and the fact that many brain injuries may have no external marker of injury, there is need for researching innovative assessment methods in detecting blast-related brain injury. To address these issues, two virtual reality-based Paced Auditory/Visual Serial Addition Tests (PA/VSAT) were developed that involve the participant being immersed in a Virtual Middle Eastern City as serial addition stimuli are presented. This study is an initial validation of the VRPASAT and VRPVSAT as assessments of neurocognitive functioning. When compared to the paper-and-pencil version of the test, as well as the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics, the VRPASAT and VRPVSAT appear to have enhanced capacity for providing an indication of a participant's performance while immersed in a military relevant simulation.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of the virtual reality version of the Multiple Errands Test based on NeuroVR software as an assessment tool for executive functions. In particular, the Multiple Errands Test is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = I 0), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (I) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups. These results suggest a possible future application of such an ecological approach for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of stroke patients and elderly population with age-related cognitive decline.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEThis study developed and validated a virtual reality (VR) simulator for use by interventional radiologists.BACKGROUNDResearch in the area of skill acquisition reports practice as essential to become a task expert. Studies on simulation show skills learned in VR can be successfully transferred to a real-world task. Recently, with improvements in technology, VR simulators have been developed to allow complex medical procedures to be practiced without risking the patient.METHODThree studies are reported. In Study I, 35 consultant interventional radiologists took part in a cognitive task analysis to empirically establish the key competencies of the Seldinger procedure. In Study 2, 62 participants performed one simulated procedure, and their performance was compared by expertise. In Study 3, the transferability of simulator training to a real-world procedure was assessed with 14 trainees.RESULTSStudy I produced 23 key competencies that were implemented as performance measures in the simulator. Study 2 showed the simulator had both face and construct validity, although some issues were identified. Study 3 showed the group that had undergone simulator training received significantly higher mean performance ratings on a subsequent patient procedure.CONCLUSIONThe findings of this study support the centrality of validation in the successful design of simulators and show the utility of simulators as a training device.APPLICATIONThe studies show the key elements of a validation program for a simulator. In addition to task analysis and face and construct validities, the authors highlight the importance of transfer of training in validation studies.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVESRecognizing that resectoscopic simulation may have an educational role, this pilot study was designed to evaluate the face validity and educational utility of a virtual reality uterine resectoscope training system.METHODSA pilot prospective comparative study of novice and expert hysteroscopists' performance on a targeting exercise and myomectomy with the virtual loop electrode. At baseline, expert and novice resectoscopists each performed both exercises. Following instruction, novices practiced each exercise a total of 9 times with the 10th recorded as the training outcome. Results were compared both to baseline and to those of the experts. Data were analyzed with the paired t and Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate.RESULTSAt baseline, all experts touched 4 targets in a mean of 33 seconds with no perforations, compared to a mean of 2 for the 11 novices in a mean of 57 seconds (P=0.0034) with one perforation. In 3 minutes, the experts removed a mean of 97.3% of the virtual myoma, compared to 66.1% for the novices (P=0.0153). On the 10th "run," novices touched a mean of 4 targets in a mean of 23 seconds, an improvement from baseline (P=0.0004) and improved to 89% on the myoma resection exercise (P=0.0515) 36.3% over baseline.CONCLUSIONAlthough this pilot study has a relatively small sample size and represents the results at one institution, it demonstrates that virtual reality resectoscopic systems have the potential to measure and improve the technical skills of novices before they operate on human patients.},

abstract={Real-time hybrid testing (RTHTing) is a relatively new form of experimental testing where only the critical components of the system are physically tested while the rest of the structure is simulated. A RTHT can provide a cost-effective means for testing semiactive controlled civil structures. This paper describes the experimental validation of the RTHT facility at the University of Connecticut through comparison of RTHT results with corresponding shake table responses of a Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid damper controlled test structure. The two-story structure has an MR damper connected between the ground and first story and is excited by ground accelerations. For the shake table tests the fully physical building model and MR damper are tested on a medium-scale shake table. In the RTHT the MR damper alone will be tested physically while the rest of the test structure and ground excitation is simulated in the RTHT control computer. The performance of the RTHT is validated by comparing the building responses and measured damper force with those from the shake table test in both the time and frequency domains.},

abstract={Orthopedic drilling as a skill demands high levels of dexterity and expertise from the surgeon. It is a basic skill that is required in many orthopedic procedures. Inefficient drilling can be a source of avoidable medical errors that may lead to adverse events. It is hence important to train and evaluate residents in safe environments for this skill. This paper presents a virtual orthopedic drilling simulator that was designed to provide visiohaptic interaction with virtual bones. The simulation provides a realistic basic training environment for orthopedic surgeons. It contains modules to track and analyze movements of surgeons, in order to determine their surgical proficiency. The simulator was tested with senior surgeons, residents and medical students for validation purposes. Through the multi-tiered testing strategy it was shown that the simulator was able to produce a learning effect that transfers to real-world drilling. Further, objective measures of surgical performance were found to be able to differentiate between experts and novices.},

The aim of the current study was to compare the performance of children with ADHD on a VR-CPT while on and off treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) and to compare the VR-CPT to a currently used CPT, Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA).METHODSTwenty-seven children with ADHD underwent the VR-CPT, the same CPT without VR (no VR-CPT), and the TOVA, 1 hour after the ingestion of either placebo or 0.3 mg/kg MPH, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Immediately following CPT, subjects described their subjective experiences on the Short Feedback Questionnaire.RESULTSMPH reduced omission errors to a greater extent on the VR-CPT compared to the no VR-CPT and the TOVA, and decreased other CPT measures on all types of CPT to a similar degree. Children rated the VR-CPT as more enjoyable compared to the other types of CPT.CONCLUSIONSIt is concluded that the VR-CPT is a sensitive and user-friendly assessment tool in measuring the response to MPH in children with ADHD.},

abstract={A key problem in studying a hypothesized spectrum of severity of delusional ideation is determining that ideas are unfounded. The first objective was to use virtual reality to validate groups of individuals with low, moderate, and high levels of unfounded persecutory ideation. The second objective was to investigate, drawing upon a cognitive model of persecutory delusions, whether clinical and nonclinical paranoia are associated with similar causal factors. Three groups (low paranoia, high nonclinical paranoia, persecutory delusions) of 30 participants were recruited. Levels of paranoia were tested using virtual reality. The groups were compared on assessments of anxiety, worry, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anomalous perceptual experiences, reasoning, and history of traumatic events. Virtual reality was found to cause no side effects. Persecutory ideation in virtual reality significantly differed across the groups. For the clear majority of the theoretical factors there were dose-response relationships with levels of paranoia. This is consistent with the idea of a spectrum of paranoia in the general population. Persecutory ideation is clearly present outside of clinical groups and there is consistency across the paranoia spectrum in associations with important theoretical variables.

abstract={The focus of this paper is on the experimental validation of a mathematical model that was developed for the flow of magnetorheological (MR) fluids through the annular gap in a MR damper. Unlike previous work by other researchers, which approximate the flow of the MR fluid through this annulus as a flow of fluid through two infinitely wide parallel plates, the model presented represents accurately the annular flow. In this paper, the mathematical model is validated via experimental testing and analysis of a double-tube MR damper fabricated at the University of Manchester, UK. The experimental setup and the procedures for executing the tests on the MR damper according to established standards for the testing of conventional automotive dampers are given. This involved sets of many isofrequency sinusoidal tests of various displacement amplitudes. Predictions from theoretical simulations based on the mathematical model are validated using the data collected from the experiments. It was found that the modeling procedure represents the MR damper very satisfactorily.},

abstract={Objective Applying genetic susceptibility information to improve health will likely require educating patients about abstract concepts, for which there is little existing research. This experimental study examined the effect of learning mode on comprehension of a genomic concept. Methods 156 individuals aged 18-40 without specialized knowledge were randomly assigned to either a virtual reality active learning or didactic learning condition. The outcome was comprehension (recall, transfer, mental models). Results Change in recall was greater for didactic learning than for active learning (p < 0.001). Mean transfer and change in mental models were also higher for didactic learning (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Believability was higher for didactic learning (p < 0.05), while ratings for motivation (p < 0.05), interest (p < 0.0001), and enjoyment (p < 0.0001) were higher for active learning, but these variables did not mediate the association between learning mode and comprehension. Conclusion These results show that learning mode affects comprehension, but additional research is needed regarding how and in what contexts different approaches are best for educating patients about abstract concepts. Practice implications Didactic, interpersonal health education approaches may be more effective than interactive games in educating patients about abstract, unfamiliar concepts. These findings indicate the importance of traditional health education approaches in emerging areas like genomics. Copyright Elsevier B.V.]},

abstract={Health professionals need to be able to communicate information about genomic susceptibility in understandable and usable ways, but substantial challenges are involved. We developed four learning modules that varied along two factors: (1) learning mode (active learning vs. didactic learning) and (2) metaphor (risk elevator vs. bridge) and tested them using a 2 x 2 between-subjects, repeated measures design. The study used an innovative virtual reality technology experimental platform; four virtual worlds were designed to convey the concept that genetic and behavioral factors interact to affect common disease risk. The primary outcome was comprehension (recall, transfer). Study participants were 42 undergraduates aged 19-23. The results indicated that the elevator metaphor better supported learning of the concept than the bridge metaphor. Mean transfer score was significantly higher for the elevator metaphor (p < 0.05). Mean change in recall was significantly higher for didactic learning than active learning (p < 0.05). Mean ratings for variables posited to be associated with better learning (e.g., motivation), however, were generally higher for the active learning worlds. The results suggested that active learning might not always be more effective than didactic learning in increasing comprehension of health information. The findings also indicated that less complex metaphors might convey abstract concepts more effectively. Reprinted by permission of Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEWe developed and instituted a laparoscopic skills curriculum based on a virtual reality simulator, LapSim (Surgical Science, Göteborg, Sweden). Our goal was to improve basic skills in our residents. The hypothesis of this study is that performance in our course will differentiate levels of experience in the training program, establishing construct validity for our curriculum.DESIGNWe designed a novel curriculum that consisted of 17 practice modules and a 7-part examination. All residents who completed the curriculum successfully were included in this study. Performance to complete the examination was analyzed. Data were stratified by level of training.SETTINGUniversity surgical skill training laboratory.PARTICIPANTSIn all, 29 residents of all levels of training and 3 attending surgeons completed the curriculum.RESULTSThe average number of practice repetitions required was 243. To complete the examination component, junior residents (R1-R3) required more repetitions than senior residents (R4, R5), 28.3 versus 13.9, respectively (p < 0.002). Tasks on camera and instrument navigation as well as coordination did not reveal significant differences. The complex grasping task demonstrated significant differences in repetitions required for each level of training: 19.5 attempts for R1, 17.2 for R2, 13 for R3, 8.5 for R4, and 3 for R5 (p < 0.04). The 2 cutting drills, which required precise use of the left hand, required 7.9 repetitions for junior residents versus 2.7 for senior residents (p < 0.009). A clip application drill differentiated among junior residents with 39.4, 19.8, and 8.5 repetitions required for R1, R2, and R3, respectively (p < 0.05). Senior residents performed equivalent to attendings on this drill. A lifting and grasping drill differentiates among junior residents, senior residents, and attendings (p < 0.03).CONCLUSIONSIndividual performance in our curriculum correlates with the level of training for many drills, which establishes construct validity for this curriculum. Noncontributory drills may need to be revised or removed from the curriculum. Successful completion of this curriculum may lead to improved resident technical performance.},

abstract={Previous studies indicate that clinopyroxene inclusions extracted from their host diamonds give super(4) super(0)Ar/ super(3) super(9)Ar ages approaching the time of source kimberlite eruption. This behaviour is attributed to diffusion of argon to the diamond/inclusion interface region during mantle residence, with subsequent loss of this component on cleaving of the diamond to release the inclusion(s). In this study, we investigate the potential of the super(4) super(0)Ar/ super(3) super(9)Ar inclusion dating method as a niche provenance tool. As diamondiferous kimberlites are uncommon igneous rocks, largely restricted to Archaean cratons and have limited age ranges, provenance studies of detrital diamond occurrences should provide unique information on craton erosional histories, palaeo-drainage evolution and related basin development. As a methodological test, super(4) super(0)Ar/ super(3) super(9)Ar step-heating and in vacuo crushing experiments were conducted on 50 eclogitic clinopyroxene inclusions extracted from diamonds from the ~93 Ma Orapa kimberlite in Botswana. Low temperature steps and crushing experiments produced anomalously old ages (up to 2.98+ /-0.10 Ga), consistent with partial retention of pre-eruption (inherited) argon in sub-micron(?) defect sites. High temperature (fusion) steps yielded significantly younger ages, although only 35% are within error of the time of Orapa kimberlite eruption. However, 77% of results are within 50 Ma, and 92% within 100 Ma, of the Orapa eruption age. These results mandate that individual fusion ages be treated as maximum estimates of source kimberlite eruption ages, with analyses of several (>6) inclusions required to date single-age detrital populations. For multi-source diamond deposits, only the youngest detrital population, or populations separated by >100 Ma, will be resolvable. Despite these limitations, we conclude that the super(4) super(0)Ar/ super(3) super(9)Ar inclusion dating method is still capable of resolving key provenance questions, such as the source of detrital diamond deposits in southern Africa, where controversy exists as to whether the diamonds originated from proximal Permo-Carboniferous glacial deposits or distal Cretaceous/Jurassic kimberlites. Finally, a model is presented to account for the variable retention of pre-eruption argon in clinopyroxene inclusions extracted from their host diamonds. The proportion of this component retained by inclusions is considered dependent on interface porosity volume, partitioning of argon into defect structures, and the timing of stress fracture development around inclusions during entrainment to surface.},

abstract={While standard neuropsychological measures have been found to have adequate predictive value, their ecological validity may diminish predictions about real world functioning. Virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly recognized as ecologically valid tools for neuropsychological assessment.

The 15 minute VRCPAT battery and 1.5 hour in-person neuropsychological assessment were conducted with a sample of 40 healthy adults, between the ages of 21 and 36, that included equivalent distributions of men and women from ethnically diverse populations. No subjects had history of psychiatric or neurologic conditions. Results supported both convergent and discriminant validity. The VRCPAT was found to correlate significantly with traditional neuropsychological tests assessing similar target constructs. No significant correlations existed between VRCPAT measures and non-target constructs. Findings suggest that the VRCPAT measures a capacity consistent with that of traditional neurocognitive measures; and is inconsistent with potential confounds. We conclude that the VRCPAT provides a unique opportunity to reliably and efficiently study neurocognitive function within an ecologically valid environment.},

abstract={Our goal is to develop a new family of automatic tools for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, using Virtual Reality Technology (VRT). VRT is specifically suitable for this purpose, because it allows for multi-modal stimulation in a complex setup, and the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters. In this work we studied sensory integration within working memory, in a navigation task through a VR maze. Along the way subjects pass through multiple rooms that include three doors each, only one of which can be used to legally exit the room. Specifically, each door is characterized by three features (color, shape and sound), and only one combination of features -- as determined by a transient opening rule -- is legal. The opening rule changes over time. Subjects must learn the rule and use it for successful navigation throughout the maze. 39 schizophrenic patients and 21 healthy controls participated in this study. Upon completion, each subject was assigned a performance profile, including various error scores, response time, navigation ability and strategy. We developed a classification procedure based on the subjects' performance profile, which correctly predicted 85% of the schizophrenic patients (and all the controls). We observed that a number of parameters showed significant correlation with standard diagnosis scores (PANSS), suggesting the potential use of our measurements for future diagnosis of schizophrenia. On the other hand, our patients did not show unusual repetition of response despite stimulus cessation (called perseveration in classical studies of schizophrenia), which is usually considered a robust marker of the disease. Interestingly, this deficit only appeared in our study when subjects did not receive proper explanation of the task.},

abstract={Current minimally invasive techniques for beating heart surgery are associated with three major limitations: the shortage of realistic and safe training methods, the process of selecting port locations for optimal target coverage from X-rays and angiograms, and the sole use of the endoscope for instrument navigation in a dynamic and confined 3D environment. To supplement the current surgery training, planning and guidance methods, we continue to develop our Virtual Cardiac Surgery Planning environment (VCSP)-a virtual reality, patient-specific, thoracic cavity model derived from 3D pre-procedural images. In this work, we create and validate dynamic models of the heart and its components. A static model is first generated by segmenting one of the image frames in a given 4D data set. The dynamics of this model are then extracted from the remaining image frames using a non-linear, intensity-based registration algorithm with a choice of six different similarity metrics. The algorithm is validated on an artificial CT image set created using an excised porcine heart, on CT images of canine subjects, and on MR images of human volunteers. We found that with the appropriate choice of similarity metric, our algorithm extracts the motion of the epicardial surface in CT images, or of the myocardium, right atrium, right ventricle, aorta, left atrium, pulmonary arteries, vena cava and epicardial surface in MR images, with a root mean square error in the 1 mm range. These results indicate that our method of modeling the motion of the heart is easily adaptable and sufficiently accurate to meet the requirements for reliable cardiac surgery training, planning, and guidance.},

abstract={This pilot study is the first known in-depth case study of the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy (VRT) as a treatment for Test Anxiety (TA). The subject of the study was a 28-year-old male, whose anxiety and avoidance behavior was interfering with his normal academic activities. For treatment, he was placed in a virtual classroom and later in a virtual auditorium. The subject was exposed to six moderately increasing in difficulty level virtual situations. The subject rated each situation for discomfort. As a simple measure of anxiety, a modified version of the Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD) scale was used every five minutes during exposure. This case study showed VRT to be an effective treatment method for reducing self-reported TA. Symptoms experienced by the subject during VRT sessions were just as real to the subject as actual test taking and general TA situations. They included increased heart rate, mild dizziness, and headaches. This case study of TA indicates that VRT may be used as an effective treatment method for reducing self-reported anxiety and improving the performance of subject(s) who suffer from TA.},

abstract={OBJECTIVESTo validate a flexible cystoscopy simulator by determining if it could differentiate between expert and novice cystoscopists.SUBJECTS AND METHODSSeventeen subjects (10 novices with no previous endoscopic experience and seven urologists who had all carried out > 1000 flexible cystoscopies each) were asked to undertake a flexible cystoscopy task on the URO Mentor (Simbionix, Israel) virtual reality (VR) machine. In the task used the bladder mucosa has 10 flags (numbered 1-10) at key positions in the bladder; by visualizing each of the 10 flags and photographing them the subject will have indirectly visualized the entire mucosa. Subjects were asked to carry out the task 10 times, to allow their rate of acquisition of skill to be assessed. The total time taken for the task and the number of flags visualized were used as measures of performance.RESULTSThe experienced urologists were significantly better at flexible cystoscopy than the medical students on the first trial for the mean number of flags seen (9.57 vs 8.0, P = 0.01) and the mean time to complete the task (2.33 vs 4.89 min, P = 0.03). At the 10th trial there was still a significant difference for the time taken, between the medical students and the urologists (2.33 vs 0.81 min, P = 0.01) but not for the number of flags seen (9.2 vs 9.6, P = 0.46). The medical students improved between the first and the 10th attempt, being significantly quicker for trial 10 than trial 1 (P = 0.005). However, although the medical students appeared to see more flags (8.0 vs 9.2) this was not significant (P = 0.05). The urologists did not differ in the number of flags visualized between the first and 10th trial, although they were significantly quicker in completing the task (P = 0.02). The urologists were significantly faster in trial 2 than trial 1, but no faster thereafter (P = 0.04).CONCLUSIONSUsing the URO Mentor simulator, it was possible to assess the level of experience of flexible cystoscopy, and therefore the system has construct validity. As in the real situation there is a period of learning during which the subject becomes familiar with the computer/machine/human interface, the task and the handling of the instruments. These results support the view that there is a role for VR simulators in urological training.},

Study B had three treatment sequences: a single dose of SLI381 30 mg as an intact capsule after overnight fast, an intact capsule after a high-fat breakfast, and the contents of a capsule sprinkled in 1 tablespoon of applesauce.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTSThe 20-mg test formulation A had comparable pharmacokinetic profiles and bioequivalence in rate and extent of drug absorption to Adderall 10 mg twice/day for both d- and l-amphetamine. Formulations B and C had statistically significant differences from the reference drug in some pharmacokinetic parameters. A 30-mg dose of SLI381 showed no significant differences in rate and extent of absorption of d- and l-amphetamine for fasted or sprinkled conditions compared with the high-fat meal condition.CONCLUSIONSLI381 20 mg/day is bioequivalent to Adderall 10 mg twice/day. SLI381 30 mg administered in applesauce is bioequivalent in terms of both rate and extent of absorption to the same dose administered as an intact capsule in both fasted and fed states.},

abstract={Hotspots and their associated intra-plate volcanism producing seamount trails have become an accepted fact in geology from a conceptual theory. The azimuths and age progressions of these seamount trails provide the only means to determine absolute plate motions with respect to an independent reference frame of `fixed' hotspots. However, the presumed fixity of hotspots is in disagreement with recent paleomagnetic studies and global-circuit plate reconstructions for the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount trail. In this study, we provide independent evidence suggesting that hotspots are not fixed relative to each other. We use a straightforward test that compares the observed super(40)Ar/ super(39)Ar age progressions along Pacific seamount trails (0-140 Myr) with the Pacific plate velocities as predicted by their poles of plate rotation (i.e. Euler poles). In most of these comparisons, the age progressions were found incompatible with published Euler poles, or with a new set of Euler poles as derived in this study using discrete seamount locations digitized from the bathymetry maps of Smith and Sandwell EOS 77 (1996) 315; Science 277 (1997) 1956-1921]. We conclude that the relative motion between hotspots may be required to reconcile the observed age progressions with the predicted plate velocities from their modeled Euler poles. On average, the Pacific hotspots may show motion at 10-60 mm/yr over the last 100 Myr, partly attributed to individual hotspot motion, whereas systematic motion of these hotspots (due to true polar wander) may account for the remainder.},
