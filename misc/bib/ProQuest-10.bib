abstract={Mr.Vc is a database of curated Vibrio cholerae transcriptome data and annotated information. The main objective is to facilitate the accessibility and reusability of the rapidly growing Vibrio cholerae omics data and relevant annotation. To achieve these goals, we performed manual curation on the transcriptome data and organized the datasets in an experiment-centric manner. We collected unknown operons annotated through text-mining analysis that would provide more clues about how Vibrio cholerae modulates gene regulation. Meanwhile, to understand the relationship between genes or experiments, we performed gene co-expression analysis and experiment-experiment correlation analysis. In additional, functional module named "Interactions" which dedicates to collecting experimentally validated interactions about Vibrio cholerae from public databases, MEDLINE documents and literature in life science journals. To date, Mr.Vc v2, which is significantly increased from the previous version, contains 107 microarray experiments, 106 RNA-seq experiments, and 3 Tn-seq projects, covering 56,839 entries of DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) from transcriptomes and 7,463 related genes from Tn-seq, respectively. and a total of 270,129 gene co-expression entries and 11,990 entries of experiment-experiment correlation was obtained, in total 1,316 entries of interactions were collected, including 496 protein-chemical signaling molecule interactions, 472 protein-protein interactions, 306 TF (Transcription Factor)-gene interactions and 42 Vibrio cholerae-virus interactions, most of which obtained from 402 literature through text-mining analysis. To make the information easier to access, Mr.Vc v2 is equipped with a search widget, enabling users to query what they are interested in. Mr.Vc v2 is freely available at http://mrvcv2.biownmc.info.},

abstract={Clinical effectiveness of hyperthermia treatments, in which tumor tissue is artificially heated to 40-44 °C for 60-90 min, can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. The need for noninvasive temperature monitoring in the head and neck region (H&N) and the potential of MR thermometry prompt us to design an MR compatible hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we validate the design, numerical model, and MR performance of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas have low reflection coefficients (<-15 dB) and the intended low interaction between the individual antenna modules (<-32 dB). A 10 °C increase in 3 min was reached in a muscle-equivalent phantom, such that the specifications from the European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology were easily reached. The MRcollar had a minimal effect on MR image quality and a five-fold improvement in SNR was achieved using the integrated coils of the MRcollar, compared to the body coil. The feasibility of using the MRcollar in an MR environment was shown by a synchronous heating experiment. The match between the predicted SAR and measured SAR using MR thermometry satisfied the gamma criteria distance-to-agreement = 5 mm, dose-difference = 7%]. All experiments combined show that the MRcollar delivers on the needs for MR-hyperthermia in the H&N and is ready for in vivo investigation.},

abstract={PURPOSELocalized prostate cancer (PCa) in patients is characterized by a dominant focus in the gland (dominant intraprostatic lesion, DIL). Accurate DIL identification may enable more accurate diagnosis and therapy through more precise targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy and focal ablative therapies. The goal of this study is to validate the performance of 18F]DCFPyL PET and CT perfusion (CTP) for detecting and localizing DIL against digital histopathological images.METHODSMulti-modality image sets: in vivo T2-weighted (T2w)-MRI, 22-min dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, CTP, and 2-h post-injection PET/MR were acquired in patients prior to radical prostatectomy. The explanted gland with implanted fiducial markers was imaged with T2w-MRI. All images were co-registered to the pathologist-annotated digital images of whole-mount mid-gland histology sections using fiducial markers and anatomical landmarks. Regions of interest encompassing DIL and non-DIL tissue were drawn on the digital histopathological images and superimposed on PET and CTP parametric maps. Logistic regression with backward elimination of parameters was used to select the most sensitive parameter set to distinguish DIL from non-DIL voxels. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was performed to determine diagnostic performance.RESULTS18F]DCFPyL PET and CTP parametric maps of 15 patients were analyzed. SUVLate and a model combining Ki and k4 of 18F]DCFPyL achieved the most accurate performance distinguishing DIL from non-DIL voxels. Both detection models achieved an AUC of 0.90 and an error rate of < 10%. Compared to digital histopathology, the detected DILs had a mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 for the Ki and k4 model and 0.7 for SUVLate.CONCLUSIONSWe have validated using co-registered digital histopathological images that parameters from kinetic analysis of 22-min dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET can accurately localize DILs in PCa for targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy, and focal ablative therapies. Short-duration dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET was not inferior to SUVLate in this diagnostic task.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERNCT04009174 (ClinicalTrials.gov).},

abstract={BACKGROUNDArabic represents one of the most frequently spoken languages worldwide, especially among refugee populations. There is a pressing need for specialized diagnostic tools corresponding to the DSM-5 criteria in Modern Standard Arabic, which can be administered on Arabic speakers in the West and Arab region alike.OBJECTIVESTo develop and validate the culturally-adapted version of the most recent M.I.N.I. 7.0.2 into Modern Standard Arabic-a form of Arabic commonly used across all Arab countries.METHODS102 participants were recruited between April 2019 to March 2020 at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin. Symptoms were assessed with Arabic versions of rater-based and self-rated measures, including Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Arabic-speaking psychiatrists saw participants for diagnostic assessment.RESULTSCohen's kappa (κ) values were moderate for major depression, and slight for post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, kappa values indicated moderate agreement between M.I.N.I.-AR and PHQ-9 for depression, as well as HTQ for post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively.CONCLUSIONThe translated and culturally adapted version of the M.I.N.I. addresses an existing need for a reliable, efficient, and effective comprehensive diagnostic tool using the most recent DSM-5 criteria in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Based on the obtained results, only a validation of the depression module (Module A) of the M.I.N.I-AR was possible. Study outcomes also show evidence for the validation of Module H covering Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Potential valuable contributions can be extended to this translation and validation.},

abstract={INTRODUCTIONThe aim was to validate the dosimetric and geometric accuracy of radiotherapy treatment plans for prostate cancer based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging only and a solution based on computed tomography (CT) supported by MR imaging.MATERIAL AND METHODSWe used CT and MR images of ten prostate cancer patients implanted with three fiducial markers (FM) in the prostate gland. Rigid registration based on FM was performed to assess the fusion accuracy between MR and CT images. The differences between prostate contours (clinical target volume - CTV) on CT (CTVCT) and MR (CTVMR) images were scored using the Dice similarity coefficient and directly comparing the outlined volumes. The volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were designed and optimised on synthetic CT (sCT) to obtain the dose distribution for the MR-only solution. In the next step, the sCT images were replaced by conventional CT images and the plans were recalculated. The doses obtained on sCT and CT were compared by direct dose subtraction and the gamma method.RESULTSThe averaged fiducial registration error was equal to 0.5 mm. All CTVCT volumes were significantly bigger than corresponding CTV delineated on MR images (p = 0.005). The direct dose comparison shows that for 97.1% of patients' bodies, the differences were smaller than 0.1%. The average gamma passing rates were higher than 0.970.CONCLUSIONSMR imaging allows for a more precise delineation of the prostate compared to CT imaging. The workflow of plan preparation based on MR and CT is burdened with an FM registration error that is eliminated by an MR-only solution with no compromise on dose distribution.},

abstract={PurposeOxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is a biomarker for the viability of brain tissue in ischemic stroke. However, acquisition of the OEF map using positron emission tomography (PET) with oxygen-15 gas is uncomfortable for patients because of the long fixation time, invasive arterial sampling, and radiation exposure. We aimed to predict the OEF map from magnetic resonance (MR) and PET images using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and to demonstrate which PET and MR images are optimal as inputs for the prediction of OEF maps.MethodsCerebral blood flow at rest (CBF) and during stress (sCBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps acquired from oxygen-15 PET, and routine MR images (T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images) for 113 patients with steno-occlusive disease were learned with U-Net. MR and PET images acquired from the other 25 patients were used as test data. We compared the predicted OEF maps and intraclass correlation (ICC) with the real OEF values among combinations of MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF.ResultsAmong the combinations of input images, OEF maps predicted by the model learned with MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF maps were the most similar to the real OEF maps (ICC: 0.597 ± 0.082). However, the contrast of predicted OEF maps was lower than that of real OEF maps.ConclusionThese results suggest that the deep CNN learned useful features from CBF, sCBF, CBV, and MR images and predict qualitatively realistic OEF maps. These findings suggest that the deep CNN model can shorten the fixation time for 15O PET by skipping 15O2 scans. Further training with a larger data set is required to predict accurate OEF maps quantitatively.},

abstract={To develop a reflective tool for promoting teacher effectiveness among preservice EFL teachers, this article seeks to investigate the effectiveness degree of an EFL teacher as it is being depicted in a popular TV show. This is conducted using the Stronge teacher evaluation system to assess the main character's level of effectiveness as an EFL teacher (Mr. Brown) in the Mind Your Language TV show. Drawing upon the intersection of the character's effectiveness within the framework of characterization, representation, and perceived realism theory, a qualitative research method involving seven performance indicators of the Stronge teacher evaluation system was adopted to assess the main character. The findings showed that the character is a highly effective EFL teacher because his personal and professional characteristics are evidenced in the evaluation system's seven performance standards. This suggests that the Show can be used as a reflective tool by preservice EFL teachers to construct and enhance their professional identities and instructional practices. This work contributes to the existing knowledge of teachers' representation in movies and its implication in preservice EFL education by providing the first study on the representation of EFL teachers in a TV show. A future research direction is also presented.},

abstract={The Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) and Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) optimization techniques are used to optimize the parameters of shear mode magneto-rheological (MR) damper design to achieve the defined objectives. The purpose is to develop a smart damper for washing machine application. The main objective is to optimize parameters like magnetic coil height, width, radius of piston road and optimum fluid volume (as this contributes to 60% cost of MR damper). The anisotropic-particle-based MR fluid (having high stress at low magnetic field strength) properties are used in optimization. GRG and GRA gave similar results for the optimized parameter values. GRA method gives additional advantages in design validation. ANOVA Minitab software is used to analyse significant contributions of each parameter in the design part. The practical shear mode MR damper was fabricated using optimized design parameters. The force–displacement curve was recorded using the damper test rig. The obtained force values at each magnetic field strength agree well with the calculated ones. The fluid volume used was 1.5 ml, and power and force values were, respectively, 5 W and 55 N. The reduced volume of MR fluid and power will help in commercializing this damper for washing machines.},

abstract={The validation of novel target-specific radioligands requires animal experiments mostly using mice with xenografts. A pre-selection based on a simpler in vivo model would allow to reduce the number of animal experiments, in accordance with the 3Rs principles (reduction, replacement, refinement). In this respect, the chick embryo or hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) model is of special interest, as it is not considered an animal until day 17. Thus, we evaluated the feasibility of quantitative analysis of target-specific radiotracer accumulation in xenografts using the HET-CAM model and combined positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For proof-of-principle we used established prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive and PSMA-negative prostate cancer xenografts and the clinically widely used PSMA-specific PET-tracer 68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. Tracer accumulation was quantified by PET and tumor volumes measured with MRI (n = 42). Moreover, gamma-counter analysis of radiotracer accumulation was done ex-vivo. A three- to five-fold higher ligand accumulation in the PSMA-positive tumors compared to the PSMA-negative tumors was demonstrated. This proof-of-principle study shows the general feasibility of the HET-CAM xenograft model for target-specific imaging with PET and MRI. The ultimate value for characterization of novel target-specific radioligands now has to be validated in comparison to mouse xenograft experiments.},

abstract={There is increased interest in the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guiding radiation therapy (RT) in the clinical setting. In this regard, preclinical studies can play an important role in understanding the added value of MRI in RT planning. In the present study, we developed and validated a clinically relevant integrated workflow for MRI-guided volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) in a VX2 rabbit neck tumor model of HNSCC. In addition to demonstrating safety and feasibility, we examined the therapeutic impact of MR-guided VMAT using a single high dose to obtain proof-of-concept and compared the response to conventional 2D-RT. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) provided excellent soft tissue contrast for accurate tumor segmentation for VMAT. Notably, MRI-guided RT enabled improved tumor targeting ability and minimal dose to organs at risk (OAR) compared to 2D-RT, which resulted in notable morbidity within a few weeks of RT. Our results highlight the value of integrating MRI into the workflow for VMAT for improved delineation of tumor anatomy and optimal treatment planning. The model combined with the multimodal imaging approach can serve as a valuable platform for the conduct of preclinical RT trials.},

abstract={PURPOSETo assess the value of MRI obtained before and after treatment in detecting mucosal healing in patients with ileal Crohn's disease (CD) treated with anti-TNF drugs.METHODSIn this IRB approved retrospective study, 24 patients (M/F 11/13, age 34.0 ± 12.5 years, age range 19-55 years) with ileal CD who underwent anti-TNF treatment, with pre- and post-treatment MRI (mean delay between MRIs 92 ± 57 weeks) were included. All patients underwent routine MR enterography (MRE), which included diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Two readers evaluated qualitative features (wall thickness, presence of edema and length of involvement) in consensus and one reader measured the following quantitative variables: relative contrast enhancement (RCE) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to derive the MaRIA and Clermont scores at baseline, post-treatment and their changes (ΔMaRIA, ΔClermont). Ileocolonoscopy results were used as the reference standard. Data was evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristics analysis to assess the utility of the measures for the detection of mucosal healing.RESULTSTwenty-four ileal segments were assessed in 24 patients. Nine patients showed mucosal healing while 15 had no mucosal healing on post-treatment endoscopy. Pre-treatment Clermont score and wall thickness and post-treatment MaRIA and Clermont scores, wall thickness, edema, length of involvement as well as ΔMaRIA and ΔClermont were all significantly different in patients with and without mucosal healing (p-range: 0.001-0.041) while MaRIA pre-treatment and ADC pre- and post-treatment were not. Pre-treatment Clermont score as well as post-treatment MaRIA and Clermont scores, wall thickness and ΔMaRIA were all significantly predictive of detection of mucosal healing (AUC 0.813-0.912; p = 0.003-0.024) after anti-TNF treatment.CONCLUSIONPre-treatment Clermont score as well as post-treatment MaRIA and Clermont scores, wall thickness and ΔMaRIA are significantly predictive of response to anti-TNF drugs in ileal Crohn's disease. These results need to be verified in a larger study.},

abstract={AIMThe aim was to design an app-based eLearning tool to provide radiographers with information about the physical basis of MR artefacts and practical elimination or/and minimisation strategies to optimise image quality, and to evaluate the impact of a smartphone app on radiographers' knowledge.METHODSThe study used the comparison-experimental approach (pre- and post-test). Thirty-five MR radiographers independently reviewed a prepared series of MR images (n = 25). The participants were requested to identify image quality related errors, to specify error-correction strategies and to score how confident they were in their responses. Participants were then divided into experimental (n = 19) and control cohorts (n = 16). The app was provided to the experimental cohort for 3 months; after this period both cohorts re-reviewed the MR image datasets and repeated their identification of image quality errors.RESULTSThe results showed a statistically significant difference between control and experimental cohorts relative to participants' pre- to post-test knowledge level. For the experimental cohort, years of experience, qualification and type of hospital were not associated with radiographer knowledge level and confidence in recognising the presence of an image quality error, naming the error and specifying appropriate correction strategies (p > 0.05).CONCLUSIONThe study identified the potential of the smartphone app as an effective educational tool to support MR radiographers' knowledge in recognising and characterising MR image quality errors.KEY POINTS• A high level of knowledge to optimise MR image quality is crucial. • Ongoing education in image quality optimisation is required. • The potential role of app as an effective educational tool is identified.},

abstract={In radiotherapy treatment planning, tumor delineation based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising technique. MR-only-based target definition becomes important with the recent development of MRI integrated radiotherapy treatment modalities. In this case series, DWI-based gross tumor volume (GTV) was validated using pathology and compared with a clinical GTV based on computed tomography (CT) imaging and MRI. This case series includes three patients with a laryngeal tumor. Prior to total laryngectomy (TLE), imaging was performed on CT and MRI, including a DWI scan. After TLE, the surgical specimen was processed and cut into 3-mm thick slices. The tumor was delineated on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained sections by a pathologist (tumorHE). This pathological imaging, including the tumorHE delineation, was three-dimensionally reconstructed and registered to the imaging. The GTV was delineated by a radiation oncologist based on CT and MR imaging (GTVclinical) and semi-automatically delineated based on DWI (GTVDWI). The microscopic tumor extent outside the GTVDWI contour was 3.0 mm, 2.7 mm, and 11.3 mm for cases I, II, and III, respectively. The microscopic tumor extent outside the GTVclinical was 7.5 mm, 2.1 mm, and 1.5 mm for cases I, II, and III, respectively. The tumor, on histology, was covered by the GTVs for 80%, 74%, and 31% (GTVDWI) and 73%, 72%, and 89% (GTVclinical) for the three subsequent cases, respectively. The GTVDWI resembled the tumorHE more than the GTVclinical in case I and case II. In case III, GTVDWI missed the caudal part of the tumor that was included in the clinical delineation due to a lack of contrast and the heterogeneous signal intensity of the tumor in DWI. In this case series, we showed the potential of DWI for MR-guided radiotherapy treatment if a clear contrast is visible. DWI-based GTV delineation might be a fast alternative to manual delineation, which could speed up the on-table target definition using an MRI-linac system. A larger case series is needed to verify these results.},

abstract={PURPOSEQuantitative susceptibility mapping is a new technique and its processing pipeline has to be validated before clinical practice. We described an easy to build magnetic resonance (MR) susceptibility phantom based on iron sucrose.MATERIALS AND METHODSIn a plastic container, Eppendorf tubes containing increasing iron sucrose concentration ranging from 0 to 60μg Fe/mL were inserted in an agarose gel. To estimate susceptibility, multiple coronal gradient echo acquisitions were performed with varying angle of the phantom relative to the B0 field, ranging from 30 to 90°. Quantitative susceptibility maps were reconstructed using the l1 and l2 norm of total variation using Split Bregman approach. Iron concentration was finally estimated from the susceptibility in the tubes.RESULTSIn l1norm susceptibility and estimated iron concentration were not different from the real values while l2norm underestimated the susceptibility. A correlation was found between the angle of the phantom and the difference between real and estimated iron concentrations. The results highlight the importance of this validation by emphasizing the effects of various reconstruction parameters as well as acquisition conditions. Using optimal parameters, the quantitative susceptibility mapping provides a very good estimation of the iron concentrations in the phantom.},

abstract={PURPOSEA splice variant of the androgen receptor, AR-V7, confers resistance to AR-targeted therapies (ATTs) but not taxane chemotherapies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Since August 2015, a clinical-grade assay to detect AR-V7 messenger RNA expression in circulating tumors cells (CTCs) has been available to providers through a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.METHODSWe contacted ordering providers of the first 150 consecutive tests by using a questionnaire-based survey to determine how the results of AR-V7 testing were used to influence clinical practice.RESULTSIn all, 142 (95%) of 150 questionnaires were completed by 38 providers from 29 sites across the United States and Canada. AR-V7 test results were reported either as CTC- (28%), CTC+/AR-V7- (30%), or CTC+/AR-V7+ (42%). Prevalence of AR-V7 detection increased with prior exposure to ATTs (abiraterone and enzalutamide naïve, 22%; after abiraterone or enzalutamide, 35%; after abiraterone and enzalutamide, 43%). Overall, management was affected by AR-V7 testing in 53% of the patients and even more often with CTC+/AR-V7+ results. AR-V7+ patients were commonly switched from ATT to taxane chemotherapy (43%) or were offered a clinical trial (43%); management remained unchanged in only 14% of these patients. Overall, patients who had a change in management on the basis of AR-V7 testing were significantly more likely to achieve a physician-reported 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen response on next-line therapy than those who did not change treatment (54% v 31%; P = .015).CONCLUSIONProviders used AR-V7 testing to influence clinical decision making more often than not. Physicians reported thatmenwithAR-V7+results had the most treatment changes, and such men were preferentially managed with taxane therapy or offered a clinical trial, which may have improved outcomes.},

abstract={Youth problem gambling is viewed as an emergent public health issue in many countries, and is also an emerging area of public concern in Portugal. However, there is currently no Portuguese instrument that focuses specifically on the measurement of problem gambling among young people. Consequently, the present study aimed to validate the DSM-IV-MR-J for use among Portuguese adolescents and to examine its' psychometric properties. A cross-cultural adaption of this instrument to the Portuguese language was performed using the translation and back translation method. The final version of the instrument was administered to 753 Portuguese high school and first year college students. The findings revealed an acceptable internal reliability and replicated the one-factor structure of this scale. Based on these findings, the Portuguese DSM-IV-MR-J appears to be a valid and reliable instrument, and provides a much needed psychometric tool for the development of more research on youth gambling in Portugal.},

abstract={The advent of neuroimaging in dental research provides exciting opportunities for relating excitation of trigeminal neurons to human somatosensory perceptions. Cold air sensitivity is one of the most frequent causes of dental discomfort or pain. Up to date, devices capable of delivering controlled cold air in an MR-environment are unavailable for quantitative sensory testing. This study therefore aimed at constructing and evaluating a novel MR-compatible, computer-controlled cold air stimulation apparatus (CASA) that produces graded air puffs. CASA consisted of a multi-injector air jet delivery system (AJS), a cold exchanger, a cooling agent, and a stimulus application construction. Its feasibility was tested by performing an fMRI stimulation experiment on a single subject experiencing dentine cold sensitivity. The novel device delivered repetitive, stable air stimuli ranging from room temperature (24.5°C ± 2°C) to -35°C, at flow rates between 5 and 17 liters per minute (l/min). These cold air puffs evoked perceptions similar to natural stimuli. Single-subject fMRI-analysis yielded brain activations typically associated with acute pain processing including thalamus, insular and cingulate cortices, somatosensory, cerebellar, and frontal brain regions. Thus, the novel CASA allowed for controlled, repetitive quantitative sensory testing by using air stimuli at graded temperatures (room temperature down to -35°C) while simultaneously recording brain responses. No MR-compatible stimulation device currently exists that is capable of providing non-contact natural-like stimuli at a wide temperature range to tissues in spatially restricted areas such as the mouth. The physical characteristics of this novel device thus holds promise for advancing the field of trigeminal and spinal somatosensory research, namely with respect to comparing therapeutic interventions for dentine hypersensitivity.},

abstract={This paper derives the asymptotic distribution for a number of rank-based and classical residual specification tests in AR-GARCH type models. We consider tests for the null hypotheses of no linear and quadratic serial residual autocorrelation, residual symmetry, and no structural breaks. We also apply our method to backtesting Value-at-Risk. For these tests we show that, generally, no size correction is needed in the asymptotic test distribution when applied to AR-GARCH residuals obtained through Gaussian quasi maximum likelihood estimation. To be precise, we give exact expressions for the limiting null distribution of the test statistics applied to (standardized) residuals, and find that standard critical values often, though not always, lead to conservative tests. For this result, we give simple necessary and sufficient conditions. Simulations show that our asymptotic approximations work well for a large number of AR-GARCH models and parameter values. We also show that the rank-based tests often, though not always, have superior power properties over the classical tests, even if they are conservative. An empirical application illustrates the relevance of these tests to the AR-GARCH models for weekly stock market return indices of some major and emerging countries. All rights reserved, Elsevier},

abstract={Radio-frequency coil arrays using dipole antenna technique have been recently applied for ultrahigh field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to obtain the better signal-noise-ratio (SNR) gain at the deep area of human tissues. However, the unique structure of dipole antennas makes it challenging to achieve sufficient electromagnetic decoupling among the dipole antenna elements. Currently, there is no decoupling methods proposed for dipole antenna arrays in MR imaging. The recently developed magnetic wall (MW) or induced current elimination decoupling technique has demonstrated its feasibility and robustness in designing microstrip transmission line arrays, L/C loop arrays and monopole arrays. In this study, we aim to investigate the possibility and performance of MW decoupling technique in dipole arrays for MR imaging at the ultrahigh field of 7T. To achieve this goal, a two-channel MW decoupled dipole array was designed, constructed and analyzed experimentally through bench test and MR imaging. Electromagnetic isolation between the two dipole elements was improved from about -3.6 dB (without any decoupling treatments) to -16.5 dB by using the MW decoupling method. MR images acquired from a water phantom using the MW decoupled dipole array and the geometry factor maps were measured, calculated and compared with those acquired using the dipole array without decoupling treatments. The MW decoupled dipole array demonstrated well-defined image profiles from each element and had better geometry factor over the array without decoupling treatments. The experimental results indicate that the MW decoupling technique might be a promising solution to reducing the electromagnetic coupling of dipole arrays in ultrahigh field MRI, consequently improving their performance in SNR and parallel imaging.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDDyssynergic defecation is a major cause of chronic functional constipation as a common digestive complaint. We clinically evaluated the effects of biofeedback therapy on the pelvic floor motion indices through magnetic resonance (MR) defecography, quality of life and depression in patients with dyssynergic defecation.METHODSIn this clinical trial study, among patients referring to the Colorectal Clinic of Hazrat Rasoul Hospital, 22 subjects were randomly assigned into two equal groups (n= 11) to receive either standard only or biofeedback and standard therapy. Dynamic changes of the pelvic floor were measured by MR defecography. During the simulated defecation, two MR defecography dynamic indices including abnormal anorectal angle change and perineal descent were measured before and after treatment. The effects of biofeedback therapy on patients' symptoms, quality of life and severity of depression were assessed and compared with the standard therapy. Statistical analysis was carried out using independent _t-test and Mann-Whitney test.RESULTSParadox index (p< 0.001), perineal descent index (p< 0.001), depression (p< 0.1), physical function (p< 0.001), vitality (p< 0.001) and role emotion (p< 0.001) significantly improved in the biofeedback therapy group in contrast to the standard therapy SDT group.CONCLUSIONBiofeedback therapy appears to be effective in improving symptoms of functional constipation and dysfunction of pelvic floor motion as well as patient's quality of life and depression state. MR defecography is able to show the changes in dynamic indices of the pelvic floor through biofeedback therapy.},

abstract={Background Family-centred service (FCS) is widely accepted now as best practice in paediatric rehabilitation. The Measure of Processes of Care-20 items set (MPOC-20) is a valid and reliable self-report measure of parents' perceptions of the extent to which health services are family-centred. Arabic-translated and validated version of the MPOC-20 (AR-MPOC-20) is used to examine Jordanian families' perception of service providers' caregiving behaviours as they receive rehabilitation services for their children with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods Parents of 114 children with CP who are receiving services at different settings in Jordan were interviewed using the AR-MPOC-20. Participating children aged 4.1 ± 4.4 years, 53.5% were males. Children varied across gross motor functional classification system (GMFCS). Parents were mostly mothers (76.3%), with at least high school education (71.9%). Results Factor analyses of the AR-MPOC-20 yielded a five-factor solution with items loaded differently from the original measure. All items correlated best and significantly with their own Arabic scale score (rs: 0.91-0.26, P < 0.01). Internal consistency values of AR-MPOC-20 scales were acceptable (Cronbach's alpha]: 0.69-0.82). Scale 'Providing Written Information' has the lowest average score (1.9 ± 1.6), while scale 'Respectful & Coordinated Care' has the highest average score (5.2 ± 1.5). Conclusion The AR-MPOC-20 is found to be a valid and reliable measure for use with Arabic-Jordanian families of children with CP. FCS is not yet well implemented in Jordan, with parents reporting more need for information about their children's health and available services. Service providers are encouraged to apply FCS in paediatric rehabilitation, and giving more attention to effective communication and information exchange with families. AR-MPOC-20 is recommended for use for program evaluation. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Testing for causality is of critical importance for many econometric applications. For bivariate AR(1) processes, the limit distributions of causality tests based on least squares estimation depend on the presence of nonstationary processes. When nonstationary processes are present, the limit distributions of such tests are usually very complicated, and the full-sample bootstrap method becomes inconsistent as pointed out in Choi (2005, Statistics and Probability Letters 75, 39-48). In this paper, a profile empirical likelihood method is proposed to test for causality. The proposed test statistic is robust against the presence of nonstationary processes in the sense the one does not have to determine the existence of nonstationary processes a priori. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed test statistic works well. Reprinted by permission of Cambridge University Press.

abstract={This study investigates the effects of foreign capital inflows and economic growth on stock market capitalization in 18 Asian countries by using the panel data from the period of 2000-2010. The AR - bound testing cointegration approach confirms the valid long run relationship between the considered variables. Results indicate that foreign direct investment has significant negative and economic growth has significant positive relationship with the stock market capitalization, whereas, the results of workers' remittances is found insignificant in long run. The error correction model confirms the significant positive relationship of economic growth and workers' remittances while, FDI has negative and significant impact on stock market capitalization in short run. Results of causality test based on Toda and Yamamoto (J Econom 66: 225-250, 1995) show the bidirectional causal relationship of foreign direct investment and economic growth with stock market capitalization. However, no causal relationship is found in between workers' remittances and stock market capitalization. It is suggested that investor should not idealize the inflow of workers' remittances to invest in Asian stock markets in long run. Simultaneously, size of the economy is a better leading indicator for Asian stock markets. On the other hand, inflows of FDI may mislead the investor to invest. Investor should keep on eye whether FDI come in the competition of domestic market or not? If this happens so investor should not invest in the stock market of host country.

note={Copyright - © 2013. World Scientific Publishing Company; Last updated - 2018-10-05},
abstract={The objective is to estimate the vastus medialis (VM) muscle force from multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (MMRE) tests and two different rheological models (Voigt and springpot). Healthy participants (N = 13) underwent multifrequency (70, 90 and 110 Hz) magnetic resonance elastography MMRE tests. Thus, in vivo experimental elastic (μ) properties of the VM in passive and active (20% MVC) conditions were characterized. Moreover, the muscle viscosity (η) was determined with Voigt and springpot rheological models, in both muscle states. Subsequently, the VM muscle forces were calculated with a generic musculoskeletal model (OpenSIM) where the active and passive shear moduli (μ) were implemented. The viscosity measured with the two rheological models increased when the muscle is contracted. During the stance and the swing phases, the VM tensile forces decrease and the VM force was lower with the springpot model. It can be noted that during the swing phase, the muscle forces estimated from springpot model showed a higher standard deviation compared to the Voigt model. This last result may indicate a strong sensitivity of the muscle force to the change of active and passive contractile components in the swing phase of gait. This study provides for the first time an estimation of the muscle tensile forces for lower limb, during human motion, from in vivo experimental muscle mechanical properties. The assessment of individualized muscle forces during motion is valuable for finite element models, increasing the patient specific parameters. This novel muscle database will be of use for the clinician to better elucidate the muscle pathophysiology and to better monitor the effects of the muscle disease.},

abstract={We know very little about the performance of point optimal (PO) and approximate point optimal (APO) tests in the presence of unavoidable nuisance parameters. Because marginal likelihood based tests are said to perform well in the presence of unavoidable nuisance parameters, this paper compares the performance of marginal likelihood based APO tests and classical tests using a testing problem which has been largely overlooked by econometric practitioners, namely testing for a static linear regression model with AR(1) errors against a dynamic linear regression model with white noise errors. It is well known that the classical tests are specifically designed for nested testing, they are applied to test for the significance of the dynamic coefficient of a dynamic linear regression model with AR(1) errors. A testing procedure is proposed, where the size and power comparisons used are based on near-exact non-similar critical values of tests obtained using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, as the near-exact non-similar critical values control the sizes of the tests well overall. Among marginal likelihood based classical tests, the likelihood ratio (LR) test and Lagrange multiplier (LM) test seem to perform well under the alternative hypothesis, particularly when the dynamic parameter is large and the sample size is reasonably big. The Wald (W) test is the worst performer overall. This concurs with previous observations that the W test performs poorly in small samples. Compared to the classical approach, APO tests appear to have good power properties, particularly in the neighborhood of the chosen parameter point under the alternative hypothesis. This finding may advance the use of PO and APO tests. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] All rights reserved, Elsevier},

abstract={OBJECTIVESCurrent quality of life inventories used in oncology mainly measure the effects of chemo- or radiotherapy alongside functional and role scales. A new approach is to measure the autonomic state of regulation with the trait-inventory of autonomic regulation (Trait-aR). Loss of Trait-aR has been shown in different medical conditions such as breast cancer (BC) but not in colorectal cancer patients (CRC). In this paper we report the validation of a new state autonomic regulation scale (State-aR) of the last week.METHODSStudy 1 included 114 participants: (41 women/16 men with cancer and 57 age- and gender-matched healthy people) to conduct a reliability-, factor- and validity-analysis. Concurrent and convergent validity was evaluated with Trait-aR, Fatigue-Numerical-Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) and the self-regulation scale, 65 participants were retested. Study 2 completed 42 participants: 17 with BC and 25 with CRC receiving chemotherapy. The State-aR was administered prior, during and after chemotherapy for measuring responsiveness.RESULTSThe factor analysis loaded to four subscales of State-aR (rest-activity, orthostatic-circulatory, thermo-sweating and digestive regulation) with a: Cronbach-α r(α) = 0.77?0.83 and a test-retest-reliability r(rt) = 0.60?0.80. The sum- and subscales correlated with their concurrent subscales in the Trait-aR (0.48?0.74) and with the sum-scale moderately with all convergent criteria (r = 0.41?-0.44; p <0.001). During chemotherapy the State-aR-sum and rest-activity-scale decreased significantly compared to the change in the Trait-aR (p <0.05).CONCLUSIONSThese findings support that the state autonomic regulation scale has satisfactory to good reliability, good validity and acceptable responsiveness in the context of chemotherapy treatment.},

Diffusion of water and solute species (e.g., Gd-based contrast agent) occurs across the fiber wall, allowing exchange between the lumen and the extralumenal space.

abstract={PURPOSEThe authors present a method to validate coregistration of breast magnetic resonance images obtained at multiple time points during the course of treatment. In performing sequential registration of breast images, the effects of patient repositioning, as well as possible changes in tumor shape and volume, must be considered. The authors accomplish this by extending the adaptive bases algorithm (ABA) to include a tumor-volume preserving constraint in the cost function. In this study, the authors evaluate this approach using a novel validation method that simulates not only the bulk deformation associated with breast MR images obtained at different time points, but also the reduction in tumor volume typically observed as a response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODSFor each of the six patients, high-resolution 3D contrast enhanced T1-weighted images were obtained before treatment, after one cycle of chemotherapy and at the conclusion of chemotherapy. To evaluate the effects of decreasing tumor size during the course of therapy, simulations were run in which the tumor in the original images was contracted by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%, respectively. The contracted area was then filled using texture from local healthy appearing tissue. Next, to simulate the post-treatment data, the simulated (i.e., contracted tumor) images were coregistered to the experimentally measured post-treatment images using a surface registration. By comparing the deformations generated by the constrained and unconstrained version of ABA, the authors assessed the accuracy of the registration algorithms. The authors also applied the two algorithms on experimental data to study the tumor volume changes, the value of the constraint, and the smoothness of transformations.RESULTSFor the six patient data sets, the average voxel shift error (mean +/- standard deviation) for the ABA with constraint was 0.45 +/- 0.37, 0.97 +/- 0.83, 1.43 +/- 0.96, and 1.80 +/- 1.17 mm for the 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% contraction simulations, respectively. In comparison, the average voxel shift error for the unconstrained ABA was 0.46 +/- 0.29, 1.13 +/- 1.17, 2.40 +/- 2.04, and 3.53 +/- 2.89 mm, respectively. These voxel shift errors translate into compression of the tumor volume: The ABA with constraint returned volumetric errors of 2.70 +/- 4.08%, 7.31 +/- 4.52%, 9.28 +/- 5.55%, and 13.19 +/- 6.73% for the 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% contraction simulations, respectively, whereas the unconstrained ABA returned volumetric errors of 4.00 +/- 4.46%, 9.93 +/- 4.83%, 19.78 +/- 5.657%, and 29.75 +/- 15.18%. The ABA with constraint yields a smaller mean shift error, as well as a smaller volume error (p = 0.031 25 for the 75% and 95% contractions), than the unconstrained ABA for the simulated sets. Visual and quantitative assessments on experimental data also indicate a good performance of the proposed algorithm.CONCLUSIONSThe ABA with constraint can successfully register breast MR images acquired at different time points with reasonable error. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an attempt to quantitatively assess in both phantoms and a set of patients the accuracy of a registration algorithm for this purpose.},

abstract={PURPOSETo investigate regional strain response during high-dose dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DS-CMR) using myocardial tagging and Strain-Encoded MR (SENC).MATERIALS AND METHODSStress induced ischemia was assessed by wall motion analysis, by tagged CMR and by SENC in 65 patients with suspected or known CAD who underwent DS-CMR in a clinical 1.5 Tesla scanner. Coronary angiography deemed as the standard reference for the presence or absence of CAD (> or =50% diameter stenosis) in all patients.RESULTSSENC and conventional tagging detected abnormal strain response in six and five additional patients, respectively, who were missed by cine images and proved to have CAD by angiography (P < 0.05 for SENC versus cine, P = 0.06 for tagging versus cine and p = NS for SENC versus tagging). On a per-vessel level, wall motion analysis on cine images showed high specificity (95%) but moderate sensitivity (70%) for the detection of CAD. Tagging and SENC yielded significantly higher sensitivity of 81% and 89%, respectively (P < 0.05 for tagging and P < 0.01 for SENC versus wall motion analysis, and p = NS for SENC versus tagging), while specificity was equally high (96% and 94%, respectively, P = NS for all).CONCLUSIONBoth the direct color-coded visualization of strain on CMR images and the generation of additional visual markers within the myocardium with tagged CMR represent useful adjuncts for DS-CMR, which may provide incremental value for the detection of CAD in humans.

abstract={Sustained tissue compression can lead to pressure ulcers, which can either start superficially or within deeper tissue layers. The latter type includes deep tissue injury, starting in skeletal muscle underneath an intact skin. Since the underlying damage mechanisms are poorly understood, prevention and early detection are difficult. Recent in vitro studies and in vivo animal studies have suggested that tissue deformation per se can lead to damage. In order to conclusively couple damage to deformation, experiments are required in which internal tissue deformation and damage are both known. Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging and T2-weighted MR imaging can be used to measure tissue deformation and damage, respectively, but they cannot be combined in a protocol for measuring damage after prolonged loading. Therefore, a dedicated finite element model was developed to calculate strains in damage experiments. In the present study, this model, which describes the compression of rat skeletal muscles, was validated with MR tagging. Displacements from both the tagging experiments and the model were interpolated on a grid and subsequently processed to obtain maximum shear strains. A correlation analysis revealed a linear correlation between experimental and numerical strains. It was further found that the accuracy of the numerical prediction decreased for increasing strains, but the positive predictive value remained reasonable. It was concluded that the model was suitable for calculating strains in skeletal muscle tissues in which damage is measured due to compression.},

abstract={The purpose of this work was to validate in phantom studies and demonstrate the clinical feasibility of MR proton resonance frequency thermometry at 1.5 T with segmented gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequences during liver tumour radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Classical GRE acquisitions and segmented GRE-EPI acquisitions were performed at 1.5 T during simultaneous RF heating with an MR-compatible RF electrode placed in an agar gel phantom. Temperature increments were calculated and compared with four optical temperature probe measurements using Bland- Altman analysis. In a preliminary clinical feasibility study, the rapid GRE-EPI sequence (echo train length = 13) was used for MR temperature monitoring of RF ablation of liver tumours in three patient procedures. For phantom experiments, the Bland-Altman mean of differences between MR and optical probe temperature measurements was <0.4 degrees C, and the 95% limits of agreement value was <1.4 degrees C. For the in vivo studies, respiratory-triggered GRE-EPI acquisitions yielded a temperature accuracy of 1.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C (acquisition time = 0.6 s/image, spatial coverage of three slices/respiratory cycle). MR proton resonance frequency thermometry at 1.5 T yields precise and accurate measurements of temperature increment with both classical GRE and rapid GRE-EPI sequences. Rapid GRE-EPI sequences minimize intra-scan motion effects and can be used for MR thermometry during RF ablation in moving organs.},

abstract={RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVESConventional tractography based on the "streamline" method only partially visualizes the pyramidal tract because of fiber crossing with other white matter tracts. Recently a new tractography method based on directional diffusion function (DDF) has been proposed. This method was reported to visualize the pyramidal tract to a larger extent than conventional techniques do. To validate the DDF-based tractography method, we studied the somatotopic organization of the pyramidal tract in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC).MATERIALS AND METHODSPyramidal tracts in the intact hemispheres of 14 brain tumor patients were drawn using the directional diffusion function-based tractography method. Each pyramidal tract was divided into four fiber bundles according to the cephalocaudal positions of their termination in the precentral gyrus. The cephalocaudal positions in the precentral gyrus of the four fiber bundles were correlated with their positional relationships in the PLIC along the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes.RESULTSFiber bundles terminating more caudally in the precentral gyrus were located significantly more anteriorly in the PLIC (r = 0.59, Spearman's correlation coefficient, P < .0001). On the other hand, no significant correlation was shown between the cephalocaudal positions in the precentral gyrus of the four fiber bundles and their relative positions in the PLIC along the mediolateral axis.CONCLUSIONSEstimated organization of the fiber bundles of the pyramidal tract in the PLIC was consistent with anatomically known somatotopic organization, which supported the validity of the DDF-based tractography method.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in individual subjects using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification of structural MR (sMR) images.BACKGROUNDLibraries of sMR scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects.METHODSOne hundred ninety patients with probable AD were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from sMR scans to give STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score; and Models II and III use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-score. Data from 140 AD and 140 CN were used for training. The SVM parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation (CV). The remaining independent sample of 50 AD and 50 CN was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm.RESULTSThe CV accuracy of Model II and Model III aSTAND-scores was 88.5% and 89.3%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary AD pathology.CONCLUSIONSThis paper presents preliminary evidence that application of SVM-based classification of an individual sMR scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of AD. Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract={For an accurate determination of the absorbed doses in complex radiation fields (e.g. mixed neutron-gamma fields), a better interpretation of the response of ionisation chambers is required. This study investigates a model of the ionisation chambers using a different approach, analysing the collected charge per minute as a response of the detector instead of the dose. The MCNPX Monte Carlo code is used. In this paper, the model is validated using a well-known irradiation field only: a (60)Co source. The detailed MCNPX models of a Mg(Ar) and TE(TE) ionisation chamber is investigated comparing the measured charge per minute obtained free-in-air and in a water phantom with the simulated results. The difference between the calculations and the measurements for the TE(TE) chamber is within +/-2% whereas for the Mg(Ar) chamber is around +7%. The systematic discrepancy in the case of Mg(Ar) chamber is expected to be caused by an overestimation of the sensitive volume.},

abstract={PURPOSETo evaluate the effect of ventilatory impairment on MR signal intensity of the lung parenchyma.MATERIALS AND METHODSSubjects were five normal volunteers (age = 30 +/- 7.9 years, mean +/- SD) and 19 male patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) (mean age = 70.4 +/- 6.5 years). Coronal MR images were obtained over entire lung fields at full inspiration and full expiration with cardiac triggering on a 1.5T system. Changes in the mean lung intensity between the two respiratory states were normalized by each intercept of the linear regression lines of the signal changes, and the slope of the relationship was calculated. Computed tomography (CT) images were also obtained in COPD patients at full inspiration using a multidetector row CT scanner. Attenuation values less than -950 Hounsfield units (HU) (RA-950) represented the percentage of relative lung area on the CT.RESULTSThe mean slope of COPD patients (0.365 +/- 0.074) was less steep than that of the normal subjects (0.570 +/- 0.124, P < 0.001). In COPD patients, the slope correlated significantly with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, r = 0.508, P = 0.026), but not with RA-950.CONCLUSIONIn COPD patients, lung signal change measured by MRI correlates with airflow obstruction, but not with volume of the emphysema measured by lung CT.},

abstract={BACKGROUND(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has documented an increased Cho/Cr ratio in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this study was to investigate neurochemical alterations in the left DLPFC, considered a main area of pathogenesis in depression, using rats exposed to the forced swimming test (FST).MATERIALS AND METHODSTwenty-four male rats were used for the MRI and in vivo(1)H MRS studies. Rats exposed to the FST to induce a depressed mental status. Using in vivo(1)H MRS, the metabolite ratios of the rats with a depressed mental status and the controls, were measured and the values of the two groups were compared.RESULTSThe Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios in the DLPFC of the rats with a depressed mental status were significantly higher than that in the controls.CONCLUSIONSThe present study demonstrates a significantly increased Cho/Cr ratio in the DLPFC of rats with depression compared with controls. This result may suggest an accelerated turnover of membrane without neuronal loss is occurring in the DLPFC of the rats with depression.},

abstract={The combination of functional MR imaging and novel robotic tools may provide unique opportunities to probe the neural systems underlying motor control and learning. Here, we describe the design and validation of a MR-compatible, 1 degree-of-freedom pneumatic manipulandum along with experiments demonstrating its safety and efficacy. We first validated the robot's ability to apply computer-controlled loads about the wrist, demonstrating that it possesses sufficient bandwidth to simulate torsional spring-like loads during point-to-point flexion movements. Next, we verified the MR-compatibility of the device by imaging a head phantom during robot operation. We observed no systematic differences in two measures of MRI signal quality (signal/noise and field homogeneity) when the robot was introduced into the scanner environment. Likewise, measurements of joint angle and actuator pressure were not adversely affected by scanning. Finally, we verified device efficacy by scanning 20 healthy human subjects performing rapid wrist flexions against a wide range of spring-like loads. We observed a linear relationship between joint torque at peak movement extent and perturbation magnitude, thus demonstrating the robot's ability to simulate spring-like loads in situ. fMRI revealed task-related activation in regions known to contribute to the control of movement including the left primary sensorimotor cortex and right cerebellum.},

abstract={RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVESPhase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique has important clinical applications in blood flow quantification and pressure gradient estimation by velocity measurement. Parallel imaging using sensitivity encoding (SENSE) may substantially reduce scan time. We demonstrate the utility of PC-MRI measurements accelerated by SENSE under clinical conditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSAccuracy and repeatability of a SENSE-PC implementation was evaluated by comparison with a commercial PC sequence with five normal volunteers. Twenty-six patients were then scanned with SENSE-PC at reduction factors (R = 1, 2, and 3). Blood flow and peak velocity were measured in the aorta and pulmonary trunk in 16 patients and peak velocity was measured at the coarctation of 10 patients. Quantitative flow, shunt ratio, and peak velocity measurements obtained with different reduction factors were compared using correlation, linear regression, and Bland-Altman statistics. All studies were approved by an Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was acquired from all subjects.RESULTSThe correlation coefficients for all comparisons were >0.962 and with high statistical significance (P < .01). Linear regression slopes ranged between 0.96 and 1.11 for flow and 0.88 to 1.05 for peak velocity. For flow, the Bland-Altman statistics yielded a total mean difference ranging from -0.02 to 0.05) L/minute with 2 standard of deviation limits ranging from -0.52 to 0.75 L/minute. For peak velocity, the total mean difference ranged from -0.10 to -0.004) milliseconds with 2-SD limits ranging from -0.062 to 0.46 milliseconds. R = 3 to R = 1 comparisons had greater 2-SD limits than R = 2 to R = 1 comparisons.CONCLUSIONSENSE PC-MRI measurements for flow and pressure gradient estimation were comparable to conventional PC-MRI.},

abstract={In order to develop accurate and effective augmented reality (AR) systems used in MR and CT guided needle placement procedures, a comparative validation environment is necessary. Clinical equipment is prohibitively expensive and often inadequate for precise measurement. Therefore, we have developed a laboratory validation system for measuring operator performance using different assistance techniques. Electromagnetically tracked needles are registered with the preoperative plan to measure placement accuracy and the insertion path. The validation system provides an independent measure of accuracy that can be applied to varying methods of assistance ranging from augmented reality guidance methods to tracked navigation systems and autonomous robots. In preliminary studies, this validation system is used to evaluate the performance of the image overlay, bi-plane laser guide, and traditional freehand techniques.},

abstract={Simulated deformations and images can act as the gold standard for evaluating various template-based image segmentation and registration algorithms. Traditional deformable simulation methods, such as the use of analytic deformation fields or the displacement of landmarks followed by some form of interpolation, are often unable to construct rich (complex) and/or realistic deformations of anatomical organs. This paper presents new methods aiming to automatically simulate realistic inter- and intra-individual deformations. The paper first describes a statistical approach to capturing inter-individual variability of high-deformation fields from a number of examples (training samples). In this approach, Wavelet-Packet Transform (WPT) of the training deformations and their Jacobians, in conjunction with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial regularization, are used to capture both coarse and fine characteristics of the training deformations in a statistical fashion. Simulated deformations can then be constructed by randomly sampling the resultant statistical distribution in an unconstrained or a landmark-constrained fashion. The paper also describes a model for generating tissue atrophy or growth in order to simulate intra-individual brain deformations. Several sets of simulated deformation fields and respective images are generated, which can be used in the future for systematic and extensive validation studies of automated atlas-based segmentation and deformable registration methods. The code and simulated data are available through our Web site.},

abstract={In this study, MR B(+)(1) imaging is employed to experimentally verify the validity of FDTD simulations of electromagnetic field patterns in human anatomies. Measurements and FDTD simulations of the B(+)(1) field induced by a 3 T MR body coil in a human corpse were performed. It was found that MR B(+)(1) imaging is a sensitive method to measure the radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field inside a human anatomy with a precision of approximately 3.5%. A good correlation was found between the B(+)(1) measurements and FDTD simulations. The measured B(+)(1) pattern for a human pelvis consisted of a global, diagonal modulation pattern plus local B(+)(1) heterogeneties. It is believed that these local B(+)(1) field variations are the result of peaks in the induced electric currents, which could not be resolved by the FDTD simulations on a 5 mm(3) simulation grid. The findings from this study demonstrate that B(+)(1) imaging is a valuable experimental technique to gain more knowledge about the dielectric interaction of RF fields with the human anatomy.},

abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain function is used in neurorehabilitation to gain insight into the mechanisms of neural recovery following neurological injuries such as stroke. The behavioral paradigms involving the use of force motor tasks utilized in the scanner often lack the ability to control details of motor performance. They are often limited by subjectiveness, lack of repeatability, and complexity that may exclude evaluation of patients with poor function. In this paper we describe a novel MR compatible wrist device that is capable of measuring isometric forces generated at the hand and joint moments along wrist flexion-extension and wrist ulnar-radial deviation axes. Joint moments measured by the system can be visually displayed to the individual and used during target matching block or event related paradigms. Through a small set of pilot testing both inside and outside the MR environment, we have found that the force tracking tasks and performance in the scanner are reproducible, and that high quality force and moment recordings can be made during fMRI studies without compromising the fMRI images. Furthermore, the device recordings are extremely sensitive making it possible for individuals with poor hand and wrist function to be tested.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEBrain volumetry is widely used for evaluating tissue degeneration; however, the parcellation methods are rarely validated and use arbitrary planes to mark boundaries of brain regions. The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and apply an MR imaging tracing method for the parcellation of 3 major gyri of the frontal lobe, which uses only local landmarks intrinsic to the structures of interest, without the need for global reorientation or the use of dividing planes or lines.METHODSStudies were performed on 25 subjects--healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease--with significant variation in the underlying gyral anatomy and state of atrophy. The protocol was evaluated by using multiple observers tracing scans of subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease and those aging normally, and the results were compared by spatial overlap agreement. To confirm the results, observers marked the same locations in different brains. We illustrated the variabilities of the key boundaries that pose the greatest challenge to defining consistent parcellations across subjects.RESULTSThe resulting gyral volumes were evaluated, and their consistency across raters was used as an additional assessment of the validity of our marking method. The agreement on a scale of 0-1 was found to be 0.83 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for the same rater and 0.85 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for 2 different raters. The results revealed that the protocol remained consistent across different neurodegenerative conditions.CONCLUSIONOur method provides a simple and reliable way for the volumetric evaluation of frontal lobe neurodegeneration and can be used as a resource for larger comparative studies as well as a validation procedure of automated algorithms.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEImaging of the anterior superficial spinal cord arteries by MR angiography is hindered by their small calibers and the similarity in configuration with the anterior superficial spinal cord veins. To validate the location and spatial configuration of the great anterior radiculomedullary artery, (ie, the Adamkiewicz artery AKA]), contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) was compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).METHODSFifteen patients with suspected spinal cord vascular pathology underwent both spinal CE-MRA and selective spinal DSA. Two phase CE-MRA was performed with the use of a centric k-space filling scheme synchronized to the contrast bolus arrival. The level and side of the AKA origin were scored on the DSA and CE-MRA images and compared regarding image quality in terms of vessel conspicuity, contrast, continuity, sharpness, and background homogeneity on a relative 5-point scale.RESULTSLocalization and spatial configuration of the AKA by CE-MRA was in agreement with DSA findings in 14 of 15 cases. One mismatch of 1 vertebral level (not side) appeared as a result of the tangled vascular pathology. Comparison of image quality revealed that DSA is superior to CE-MRA concerning vessel continuity, sharpness, and background homogeneity (P < .001). Overall vessel conspicuity and contrast were judged to be similar.CONCLUSIONCE-MRA can visualize and localize the level of the AKA correctly. Image quality of CE-MRA is sufficient for detection of the AKA but is inferior to DSA.},

abstract={Our goal was to determine the value of echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging in detecting the presence of primary acquired and residual cholesteatoma. One hundred patients were evaluated by preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The patient population consisted of a first group of 55 patients evaluated in order to detect the presence of a primary acquired cholesteatoma. In the second group, 45 patients were evaluated for the presence of a residual cholesteatoma 8-18 months after cholesteatoma surgery, prior to second-look surgery. Surgical findings were compared with preoperative findings on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of both groups was assessed. In the group of primary surgery patients, hyperintense signal compatible with cholesteatoma was found in 89% of cases with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for DWI of 81, 100, 100 and 40%, respectively. In the group of second-look surgery patients, only one of seven surgically verified residual cases was correctly diagnosed using DWI, with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 12.5, 100, 100 and 72%, respectively. These results confirm the value of DWI in detecting primary cholesteatoma, but show the poor capability of DWI in detecting small residual cholesteatoma.},

abstract={As population-based epidemiologic studies may acquire images from thousands of subjects, automated image post-processing is needed. However, error in these methods may be biased and related to subject characteristics relevant to the research question. Here, we compare two automated methods of brain extraction against manually segmented images and evaluate whether method accuracy is associated with subject demographic and health characteristics. MRI data (n = 296) are from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, a population-based study of elderly Japanese-American men. The intracranial space was manually outlined on the axial proton density sequence by a single operator. The brain was extracted automatically using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) and BSE (Brain Surface Extractor) on axial proton density images. Total intracranial volume was calculated for the manually segmented images (ticvM), the BET segmented images (ticvBET) and the BSE segmented images (ticvBSE). Mean ticvBSE was closer to that of ticvM, but ticvBET was more highly correlated with ticvM than ticvBSE. BSE had significant over (positive error) and underestimated (negative error) ticv, but net error was relatively low. BET had large positive and very low negative error. Method accuracy, measured in percent positive and negative error, varied slightly with age, head circumference, presence of the apolipoprotein eepsilon4 polymorphism, subcortical and cortical infracts and enlarged ventricles. This epidemiologic approach to the assessment of potential bias in image post-processing tasks shows both skull-stripping programs performed well in this large image dataset when compared to manually segmented images. Although method accuracy was statistically associated with some subject characteristics, the extent of the misclassification (in terms of percent of brain volume) was small.},

abstract={A noninvasive NMR technique for evaluating testicular function was explored in this study. Localized in vivo 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on rat testes using a stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence with a short echo time (TE). In the 1H spectra, large lipid signals dominated the chemical shift range of 0.89-2.78 ppm, which prevented the observation of metabolite signals in this region. To suppress these lipid signals, short inversion time (TI) inversion recovery (STIR) was combined with STEAM (STIR-STEAM). The optimal TI was typically 320 ms. STIR-STEAM with a TE of 15 ms allowed successful suppression of the lipid signals and the sensitive detection of several new metabolite signals. In normal testes, choline, creatine, glutamate, and glycine signals were identified. In addition to these metabolites, a lactate signal was observed in ischemic testes. To our knowledge, the signals of glutamate, glycine, and lactate have not been previously assigned in 1H MR spectra of testes in vivo. Lipid suppression by STIR aided in the detection of these metabolites, which would otherwise have been masked by the lipid signals.},

abstract={Post-implantation dosimetry is an important element of permanent prostate brachytherapy. This process relies on accurate localization of implanted seeds relative to the surrounding organs. Localization is commonly achieved using CT images, which provide suboptimal prostate delineation. On MR images, conversely, prostate visualization is excellent but seed localization is imprecise due to distortion and susceptibility artefacts. This paper presents a method based on fused MR and x-ray images acquired consecutively in a combined x-ray and MRI interventional suite. The method does not rely on any explicit registration step but on a combination of system calibration and tracking. A purpose-built phantom was imaged using MRI and x-rays, and the images were successfully registered. The same protocol was applied to three patients where combining soft tissue information from MRI with stereoscopic seed identification from x-ray imaging facilitated post-implant dosimetry. This technique has the potential to improve on dosimetry using either CT or MR alone.},

abstract={To evaluate the feasibility of MR colonography (MRC) with air using two-dimensional (2D) T1-weighted fast spin-echo (T1wFSE) in patients scheduled for conventional colonoscopy (CC) after classic bowel preparation, and assess the ability of the technique to detect colonic lesions. The distention was sufficient for diagnosis, and the technique provided adequate delineation of the wall in the majority of segments. Residual fluid obscured the wall in different segments, especially in the ascending and descending colon (supine position) and in the cecum, transverse, and sigmoid colon (prone position). These findings were consistent with CT colonography. MRC visualized three lesions, missed one lesion >10 mm, visualized none of four lesions <5 mm, and yielded one false-positive lesion (5-10 mm). Missed lesions can be due to inconsistency in the slice positions between consecutive breath-holds, which is inherent to the multishot technique. Residual fluid may have obscured the smaller lesions. The shortcomings of the technique are limited coverage and signal drop-off at the borders of the field of view (FOV). Before multishot 2D T1wFSE colonography can become a valid screening method, improved patient preparation and a more practical technique are needed.},

abstract={PURPOSETo validate the accuracy of ventricular function analysis using a single breath-hold real-time steady sate free precession (SSFP) cine MR method and demonstrate its application during adenosine stress imaging in children with congenital heart disease.MATERIALS AND METHODSTwenty-eight subjects with congenital heart disease were studied (mean age 12.4 +/- 2.3 years) with MR imaging at 1.5 T. Short-axis images covering the entirety of both ventricles were acquired at rest, with a conventional segmented SSFP cine sequence acquired over multiple breath-holds and a single breath-hold real-time SSFP sequence. Seventeen subjects were given an infusion of adenosine, and the single breath-hold real-time short-axis stack was repeated during stress. Two independent observers performed the ventricular function analysis. Data was compared between the 2 acquisition methods at rest and between the single breath-hold acquisition at rest and during adenosine stress.RESULTSThere was good agreement between the multiple breath-hold and single breath-hold methods for measurement of end-diastolic volume (r = 0.95 and 0.96, p < .0001) and end-systolic volume (ESV) (r = 0.76 and 0.90, p < .0001) for the left and right ventricles respectively, and the left ventricular mass (r = 0.97, p < .0001). Adenosine was administered safely to all subjects. During stress there were significant changes in the heart rate and ESV, which led to a significant increase in cardiac output (mean 1.5 +/- 1.0 L/min, p < .001).CONCLUSIONSingle breath-hold real-time SSFP cine imaging is robust and accurate in assessing cardiac function in children with congenital heart disease. An application of this method is the rapid assessment of cardiac function during adenosine stress.},

abstract={PURPOSEBrain tumor radiotherapy requires the volume measurements and the localization of several individual brain structures. Any tool that can assist the physician to perform the delineation would then be of great help. Among segmentation methods, those that are atlas-based are appealing because they are able to segment several structures simultaneously, while preserving the anatomy topology. This study aims to evaluate such a method in a clinical context.METHODS AND MATERIALSThe brain atlas is made of two three-dimensional (3D) volumes: the first is an artificial 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the second consists of the segmented structures in this artificial MRI. The elastic registration of the artificial 3D MRI against a patient 3D MRI dataset yields an elastic transformation that can be applied to the labeled image. The elastic transformation is obtained by minimizing the sum of the square differences of the image intensities and derived from the optical flow principle. This automatic delineation (AD) enables the mapping of the segmented structures onto the patient MRI. Parameters of the AD have been optimized on a set of 20 patients. Results are obtained on a series of 6 patients' MRI. A comprehensive validation of the AD has been conducted on performance of atlas-based segmentation in a clinical context with volume, position, sensitivity, and specificity that are compared by a panel of seven experimented physicians for the brain tumor treatments.RESULTSExpert interobserver volume variability ranged from 16.70 cm(3) to 41.26 cm(3). For patients, the ratio of minimal to maximal volume ranged from 48% to 70%. Median volume varied from 19.47 cm(3) to 27.66 cm(3) and volume of the brainstem calculated by AD varied from 17.75 cm(3) to 24.54 cm(3). Medians of experts ranged, respectively, for sensitivity and specificity, from 0.75 to 0.98 and from 0.85 to 0.99. Median of AD were, respectively, 0.77 and 0.97. Mean of experts ranged, respectively, from 0.78 to 0.97 and from 0.86 to 0.99. Mean of AD were, respectively, 0.76 and 0.97.CONCLUSIONSResults demonstrate that the method is repeatable, provides a good trade-off between accuracy and robustness, and leads to reproducible segmentation and labeling. These results can be improved by enriching the atlas with the rough information of tumor or by using different laws of deformation for the different structures. Qualitative results also suggest that this method can be used for automatic segmentation of other organs such as neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and limbs.},

abstract={The mechanism by which lithium exerts either its anti-manic or antidepressant effects remains to be fully elucidated. Although lithium inhibits the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) at concentrations that are relevant for treatment of bipolar disorder, it is unclear whether GSK-3-related mechanisms are responsible for its therapeutic effects in the treatment of this disease. We report that AR-A014418 (a selective GSK-3 inhibitor) induces behavioural changes that are consistent with the effects of antidepressant medications. Subacute intraperitoneal injections of AR-A014418 reduced immobility time in rats exposed to the forced swim test, a well-established model for antidepressant efficacy. In addition, the specificity of this effect is supported by our finding that AR-A014418 decreased spontaneous as well as amphetamine-induced activity. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that lithium may exert its antidepressant effects through inhibition of GSK-3, and that novel small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder and depression.},

abstract={In this paper the concept of using B1+ imaging as a means to validate SAR models for radiofrequency hyperthermia is presented. As in radiofrequency hyperthermia, in common clinical MR imaging which applies RF frequencies between 64 and 128 MHz, the RF field distribution inside a patient is largely determined by the dielectric distribution of the anatomy. Modern MR imaging techniques allow measurement of the RF magnetic field component B1+ making it possible to measure at high resolution the dielectric interaction of the RF field with the patient. Given these considerations, we propose to use MR imaging to verify the validity of our dielectric patient model used for SAR models of radiofrequency hyperthermia. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of this concept by performing B1+ measurements and simulations on cylindrical split phantoms consisting of materials with dielectric properties similar to human tissue types. Important topics of investigation were the accuracy and sensitivity of B1+ measurements and the validity of the electric model of the MR body coil. The measurements were performed on a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner with its quadrature body coil operating at 64 MHz. It was shown that even small B1+ variations of 2 to 5% could be measured reliably in the phantom experiments. An electrical model of the transmit coil was implemented on our FDTD-based hyperthermia treatment planning platform and the RF field distributions were calculated assuming an idealized quadrature current distribution in the coil. A quantitatively good correlation between measurements and simulations was found for phantoms consisting of water and oil, while highly conductive phantoms show considerable deviations. However, assuming linear excitation for these conductive phantoms resulted in good correspondence. As an explanation it is suggested that the coil is being detuned due to the inductive nature of the conductive phantoms, breaking up the phase difference of pi/2 between the two quadrature modes. It is concluded that B1+ imaging is an accurate and sensitive method for obtaining quantitative information about the RF field in phantoms. The electrical model of the body coil is inadequate for highly conductive phantoms. It is expected that for experiments on human bodies the inductive coupling is also significant, demonstrating the need for a full resonant FDTD model of the transmit coil. This will be pursued in the near future.},

Ten patients had oropharyngeal, 13 had laryngeal, and six had hypopharyngeal tumors. CT, MR imaging, and PET were performed with patients immobilized in a customized thermoplastic mask, and images were coregistered. GTVs obtained with the three modalities were compared quantitatively and qualitatively. If patients underwent total laryngectomy, images were validated with the surgical specimen after three-dimensional coregistration. The effect of each modality was estimated with linear mixed-effects models. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made with the Bonferonni or Sidak method.RESULTSFor oropharyngeal tumors and for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal tumors, no significant difference (P >.99) was observed between average GTVs delineated at CT (32.0 and 21.4 cm(3), respectively) or MR imaging (27.9 and 21.4 cm(3), respectively), whereas average GTVs at PET were smaller (20.3 P keywords={Radiopharmaceuticals; 0; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; 0Z5B2CJX4D; Index Medicus; Single-Blind Method; Humans; Middle Aged; Male; False Positive Reactions; Laryngectomy; Aged, 80 and over; Adult; Female; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Neoplasm Staging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pharyngeal Neoplasms -- pathology; Laryngeal Neoplasms -- surgery; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Pharyngeal Neoplasms -- surgery; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell -- surgery; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell -- pathology; Laryngeal Neoplasms -- pathology},

abstract={Until now, patients with a shoulder instability being examined using magnetic resonance imaging have been placed in a position with the arm adducted or in the ABER position, as a result of the way conventional MR systems are built. Magnetic resonance systems with an open configuration have made it possible, for the first time, to examine patients in the apprehension-test position, which is a representative diagnostic position for anterior shoulder instability. This new examination position requires an exact understanding of layered imaging anatomy in order to clearly identify MR structures. The purpose of this study is to make possible a direct comparison of the respective abilities of MR cross-section imaging and thin-layer plastination to clearly identify all MR structures of the shoulder positioned in the apprehension-test position. The two shoulders of a body donor were separated and stored in special position supports in the apprehension-test position. The magnetic resonance examination was carried out using a vertically open 0.5-T MR system (Signa SP/i, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). The following sequences were used: 2D GRE, TR 42.5 ms, TE 20 ms, layer width 3 mm, matrix 512x512, FOV 24 cm. The coronary und transversal MR cross-section segments were subsequently planned in conjunction with thin-layer plastination for both shoulders. Using a direct comparison of MR images with the corresponding thin-layer plastination, it was possible to clearly identify all MR structures.},

abstract={PURPOSETo define a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pattern suggestive of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect CMV DNA in neonatal blood on Guthrie cards for validation.MATERIALS AND METHODSOn the basis of findings in eight patients with documented congenital CMV infection, the authors developed MR imaging inclusion criteria, including multifocal lesions predominantly located in the deep parietal white matter. If gyral abnormalities were present, white matter lesions were either multifocal or diffuse. The criteria were applied to 152 patients with static leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology. Guthrie cards for 22 of the 43 patients fulfilling the MR imaging criteria, 20 patients not fulfilling them, and 300 control subjects were analyzed. Fisher exact testing was used to evaluate the association between MR imaging characteristics and CMV status, and backward elimination linear discriminant analysis was used to identify MR imaging characteristics predictive of CMV infection in addition to the initial criteria.RESULTSPCR test results were positive in 12 of 22 patients suspected of having congenital CMV infection, in no patient not suspected of having infection (P <.001), and in two of 300 control subjects (negative predictive value NPV] of MR imaging criteria, 100% 95% CI: 83%, 100%]; positive predictive value PPV], 55% 95% CI: 32%, 76%]). The most important additional MR imaging finding predicting a positive PCR result was abnormality of the anterior part of the temporal lobe, including abnormal white matter, cysts, and enlargement of inferior horns. Including this finding in the MR imaging criteria enhanced the PPV (89%; 95% CI: 52%, 99%) at the expense of the NPV (88%; 95% CI: 72%, 97%).CONCLUSIONIn patients with static encephalopathy, an MR imaging pattern of multifocal lesions predominantly involving deep parietal white matter, with or without gyral abnormalities, is predictive of congenital CMV infection. When gyral abnormalities are present, leukoencephalopathy may also be diffuse. The presence of abnormalities in the anterior part of the temporal lobe increases the likelihood that CMV infection is present.},

abstract={Vessel-wall measurements from multicontrast MRI provide information on plaque structure and evolution. This requires the extraction of numerous contours. In this work a contour-extraction method is proposed that uses an active contour model (NLSnake) adapted for a wide range of MR vascular images. This new method employs length normalization for the purpose of deformation computation and offers the advantages of simplified parameter tuning, fast convergence, and minimal user interaction. The model can be initialized far from the boundaries of the region to be segmented, even by only one pixel. The accuracy and reproducibility of NLSnake endoluminal contours were assessed on vascular phantom MR angiography (MRA) and high-resolution in vitro MR images of rabbit aorta. An in vivo evaluation was performed on rabbit and clinical data for both internal and external vessel-wall contours. In phantoms with 95% stenoses, NLSnake measured 94.3% +/- 3.8%, and the accuracy was even better for milder stenoses. In the images of rabbit aorta, variability between NLSnake and experts was less than interobserver variability, while the maximum intravariability of NLSnake was equal to 1.25%. In conclusion, the NLSnake technique successfully quantified the vessel lumen in multicontrast MR images using constant parameters.},

abstract={Using stringent criteria for protein identification by accurate mass and time (AMT) tag mass spectrometric methodology, we detected 36 proteins of <101 amino acids in length, including 10 that were annotated as hypothetical proteins, in 172 global tryptic digests of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 proteins. Peptides that map to the conserved, but functionally uncharacterized proteins SO4134 and SO2787, were the most frequently detected peptides in these samples, while those that map to hypotheticals SO2669 and SO2063, conserved hypotheticals SO0335 and SO2176, and the SlyX protein (SO1063) were observed at frequencies similar to those from essential small proteins (ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factor IF-1), suggesting that they may function in similarly important cellular functions. In addition, peptides were detected that map to 30 genes predicted to encode frameshifts, point mutations, or recoding signals. Of these 30 genes, peptides that map to positions beyond internal stop codons were detected in 13 genes (SO0101, SO0419, SO0590, SO0738, SO1113, SO1211, SO3079, SO3130, SO3240, SO4231, SO4328, SO4422, and SO4657). While expression of the full-length formate dehydrogenase encoded by SO0101 can be explained by incorporation of selenocysteine at the internal stop codon, the mechanism of translating downstream sequences in the remaining genes remains unknown.},

However, such data postprocessing is very time-consuming and has limited accuracy due to difficulties in precise tracing of the thin vessel wall.PURPOSETo assess the accuracy and reproducibility of quantitative vascular MR imaging applying a data analysis method based on (1) vessel wall unwrapping, followed by (2) a gradient detection algorithm for MR data postprocessing. Vascular MR imaging studies were done both in vessel phantoms and in healthy volunteers (n=29) on a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner. A dark blood double-inversion turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression was applied, with proton-density-weighted and breath-hold acquisition for aortic imaging and T2-weighted acquisition for carotid imaging. Intraobserver and interobserver variability were systematically evaluated by two independent observers. A repeat study within 10 days of the first MRI was performed in 10 of these subjects for assessment of interstudy reproducibility.RESULTSThe semiautomated edge detection software revealed a clear view of the inner and outer vessel wall boundaries both in the phantoms and in the volunteers studied. There was close agreement between MR-derived measurements and phantom dimensions (mean difference of 1.1+/-16.9 mm2, 8.0+/-19.9 mm2, 9.0+/-12.1 mm2 for vessel wall cross-sectional area, inner vessel area, and total vessel area, respectively). Quantification of vessel dimensions was feasible in all 29 healthy volunteers studied. Semiautomated quantification of cross-sectional vessel wall area (mean+/-SD, 253.6+/-208.4 mm2) revealed close correlation for repeated measurements by one or two observers (r=0.99 each). Both intraobserver and interobserver variability of vessel wall area MR measurements were low (mean difference 7.5+/-16.7 mm2 and 14.4+/-24.6 mm2 , respectively). In the repeat study of 10 volunteers, MRI with semiautomated postprocessing quantitation revealed a high correlation and agreement of vessel dimensions between the two scans (r=0.994, mean difference 2.6+/-25.1 mm2).CONCLUSIONSemiautomated analysis methods can provide approaches that benefit from the human understanding of the image and the computer's ability to measure precisely and rapidly. Thus, by combining the latest MRI methods and semiautomated image analysis methods, we are now able to reproducibly determine the geometric parameters of blood vessels.},

abstract={MRI-based measures of cartilage morphology are being increasingly used as surrogate markers in osteoarthritis. In contrast to other knee joint surfaces, quantitative analysis of the femoral condyles from sagittal MRI suffers from limited precision. The objective, therefore, was to develop a technique for reproducible assessment of femoral cartilage morphology from coronal image data. Coronal MR images (3D T(1)-w FLASHwe) of the knee were obtained in 16 healthy volunteers and in 7 patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA, prior to knee arthroplasty), with repositioning between repeated scans. After segmentation the cartilage volume, thickness, and joint surface areas were quantified in the tibia and in an anatomically defined region of the femoral condyle. Immediate test-retest interscan precision errors (CV%) for femoral cartilage volume were 3.0% (SD = 26 microl) and 3.2% (29 microl) medially and laterally in volunteers, and 3.0% (34 microl) and 7.0% (37 microl) in OA patients. The estimated loss, from cross sectional data, in the patients in the medial femoral condyle (-61%/-4.4 SD) was higher than that in the medial tibia (-45%/-3.1 SD) and compared favorably with precision errors (ratio > 16:1). The technique proposed overcomes some of the problems associated with sagittal scans and thus shows high promise for reliable assessment of femoro-tibial cartilage loss in OA.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a central production facility with distribution network for implementation of hyperpolarized 3-helium MRI. The 3-helium was hyperpolarized to 50-65% using a large-scale production facility based at a university in Germany. Using a specially designed transport box, containing a permanent low-field shielded magnet and dedicated iron-free glass cells, the hyperpolarized 3-helium gas was transported via airfreight to a university in the UK. At this location, the gas was used to perform in vivo MR experiments in normal volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases. Following initial tests, the transport (road-air-road cargo) was successfully arranged on six occasions (approximately once per month). The duration of transport to imaging averaged 18 h (range 16-20 h), which was due mainly to organizational issues such as working times and flight connections. During the course of the project, polarization at imaging increased from 20% to more than 30%. A total of 4 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were imaged. The feasibility of a central production facility for hyperpolarized 3-helium was demonstrated. This should enable a wider distribution of gas for this novel technology without the need for local start-up costs.},

abstract={As a model for guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency in humans, a gene knockout mouse model was generated. Here we report on several metabolic abnormalities in these mice, observed by in vivo and in vitro MR spectroscopy. In (1)H MR spectra of brain and hindleg muscle a clearly reduced signal of creatine (Cr) was observed in GAMT-deficient (GAMT-/-) animals. Analysis of the (1)H MR spectra of GAMT-/- brain indicated little or no increase of a signal for guanidinoacetate (Gua). In proton MR spectra of muscle, a broad signal of low intensity was observed for Gua. However, substantial Gua accumulation in intact muscle tissue was unequivocally confirmed in high-resolution magic angle spinning spectra, in which the Gua signal was resolved as one clear sharp singlet. In (31)P MR analysis of brain and hindleg muscle a strongly reduced phosphocreatine (PCr) content was shown. In addition, a signal of phosphorylated Gua at 0.5 ppm upfield of PCr was observed, with much higher intensity in muscle than in brain. This signal decreased when ischemia was applied to the muscle and recovered after ischemia was released. Overall, the in vivo (31)P and (1)H MR spectroscopy of GAMT-/- mice is similar to that of human GAMT deficiency. This opens up new avenues for the fundamental study of tissue-type dependence of creatine synthesis and transport and for diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of creatine deficiencies in humans.},

abstract={PURPOSETo assess the impact of the accelerated dynamic MR imaging (ADMRI) approach using parallel imaging for detecting hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and to evaluate the usefulness of a test bolus in examination and subtraction imaging in this setting.MATERIALS AND METHODSThirty patients with 135 HCCs underwent ADMRI using a two-dimensional gradient-recalled echo sequence with parallel imaging. Seventeen patients were evaluated without a test bolus and 13 patients with a test bolus. The detectability of HCCs was calculated between the groups with and without a test bolus. ADMRI was evaluated regarding the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the lesion and the liver, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the lesion vs. the liver, and the feasibility of subtraction images.RESULTSADMRI with and without a test bolus had almost equal sensitivity (92.5% and 92.6%). No significant difference was seen in the SNR of lesions and the CNR of lesions vs. livers between both groups. With a test bolus, ADMRI could depict the peak enhancement of nodules on the 2nd or 3rd dynamic phases and optimized the timing of peak lesion enhancement. Subtraction images could be obtained regarding minimal slice misregistration.CONCLUSIONADMRI had high detectability of HCCs with and without a test bolus.},

abstract={PURPOSETo establish a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol for noninvasive in-vivo analysis of atherosclerotic femoral artery segments in humans and to compare the results to those of intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS).MATERIALS AND METHODSIn seven patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, 20 femoral arterial segments per person were examined by high-resolution (HR) MR imaging and IVUS. Comparison was possible in 123 of 140 segments. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T with use of a three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight sequence with an in-plane resolution of 0.78 x 0.49 mm(2). 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography was used for exact positioning of the HR MR imaging slices. IVUS (3.5 F, 40 MHz) was performed with use of a motorized pullback system. Parameters analyzed included cross-sectional lumen area (LA), vessel area (VA), and extent of vessel wall calcification.RESULTSAgreement between IVUS and HR MR imaging was analyzed with use of the Bland-Altman method. The paired LA measurements were in close agreement: the Bland-Altman mean bias in LA was -0.4 mm with a precision of +/-5.1 mm (P =.062). As a result of dorsal echo extinction in IVUS, VA measurements were feasible in only 74 of 140 segments. VA measurements were moderately correlated (r = 0.74; P <.0001), and a 25% overestimation by HR MR imaging compared to IVUS was observed. Intra- and interobserver comparisons for LA and VA measured with HR MR imaging did not show significant differences. Vessel wall calcifications were classified with a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 93%, and an accuracy of 93%.CONCLUSIONSThe MR imaging protocol introduced in the present study permits precise assessment of LA and extent of calcification in peripheral arterial occlusive disease in vivo. HR MR imaging shows high concordance with IVUS and may have the potential for noninvasive therapy monitoring.},

abstract={The mechanical properties of in vivo soft tissue are generally determined by palpation, ultrasound measurements (US), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). While it has been shown that US and MRE are capable of quantitatively measuring soft tissue elasticity, there is still some uncertainty about the reliability of quantitative MRE measurements. For this reason it was decided to determine in vitro how MRE measurements correspond with other quantitative methods of measuring characteristic elasticity values. This article presents the results of experiments with tissue-like agar-agar gel phantoms in which the wavelength of strain waves was measured by shear wave MR elastography and the resultant shear modulus was compared with results from mechanical compression tests with small gel specimens. The shear moduli of nine homogeneous gels with various agar-agar concentrations were investigated. The elasticity range of the gels covered the elasticity range of typical soft tissues. The systematic comparison between shear wave MRE and compression tests showed good agreement between the two measurement techniques.},

Experiments were conducted on 25-35 kg Yorkshire pigs (N = 5) under ketamine/isoflurane anesthesia. Ventilation and perfusion MR images were obtained using laser polarized gas and gadolinium (Gd), respectively. The mutual information-based technique was used to quantify the initial misregistration between the acquired ventilation and perfusion images, to cope with different intensity characteristics. Means and standard deviations (SDs) of misregistrations for the five subjects, in terms of absolute translation and absolute rotations around each of the three coordinate axes, were computed to evaluate the hypothesis. For qualitative illustrations, plots of mutual information values under absolute translations and rotations around each of the three coordinate axes are presented. This preliminary study shows the feasibility of acquiring functional image data that are spatially co-registered. This method has potential applications in the quantitative assessment of regional alveolar ventilation and pulmonary perfusion ratio, in both normal and diseased lung.},

abstract={OBJECTIVEWe performed a prospective clinical test of a high-spatial-resolution model-based parametric method for diagnosis of breast lesions detected on contrast-enhanced MR imaging.SUBJECTS AND METHODSFifty-seven women with 68 pathologically confirmed breast lesions were imaged (45 masses, 23 microcalcifications). Seven consecutive 2-min three-dimensional gradient-recalled echo acquisitions were performed after suitably timed gadopentetate dimeglumine injections. We derived a composite parametric image from three judiciously selected time points (three-time-point method), using a model-based kinetic algorithm. In this composite image, color brightness and hue signify contrast uptake and washout characteristics related to the product of microvessel surface area and permeability, as well as to the extracellular volume fraction. The reviewer was provided with the slice location of lesions, but with no other radiographic or clinical information. The reviewer then classified the lesions as benign or malignant using a 5-step receiver operating characteristic scale.RESULTSObservers using the three-time-point method correctly diagnosed 27 of 31 malignant and 31 of 37 benign lesions (sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 84%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.911. False-negative results were found for three patients with low- to intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ and one patient with 5-mm invasive ductal cancer. For the 45 solid lesions, sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 82%, respectively.CONCLUSIONApplication of the three-time-point method permitted, in most cases, differentiation of malignant and benign lesions, even in the presence of complex breast enhancement patterns. Sensitivity for solid tumors was higher than for ductal carcinoma in situ.},

abstract={PURPOSETo prospectively determine whether a relationship exists between magnetic resonance (MR) imaging abnormalities of the right ventricle (RV) and intracardiac electrophysiologic (EP) test results in patients with myotonic dystrophy.MATERIALS AND METHODSConventional T1-weighted single-shot black-blood fast spin-echo and gradient-echo MR imaging of the heart was prospectively performed in 32 patients with myotonic dystrophy who required EP testing. Patients were divided into two groups according to EP test results: (a) inducible (n = 15), indicating inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and (b) noninducible (n = 17). Morphologic and functional MR data were analyzed by two independent investigators. Nonparametric statistical methods and kappa statistics were used.RESULTSNo morphologic or functional abnormalities of the RV wall were observed in noninducible patients. Increased signal intensity of the RV wall, indicative of fatty replacement, was identified in 13 inducible patients. Myocardial thinning of the RV was observed in six inducible patients. An overlap of morphologically abnormal areas and areas of hypo- or dyskinesis were present in 11 inducible patients. RV outflow tract diameter was larger and RV ejection fraction was smaller in inducible patients than in noninducible patients, although differences were not significant. Interobserver agreement for MR findings was good (increased signal intensity: kappa = 0.87, P >.30 pairwise Wilcoxon signed rank test]; myocardial thinning: kappa = 0.87, P >.30; hypo- or dyskinesis: kappa = 1.00, P >.99). There was a strong relationship between MR abnormalities and inducibility during EP testing (increased signal intensity, P <.001; myocardial thinning, P <.01; hypo- or dyskinesis, P <.01).CONCLUSIONThe relationship between MR morphologic and functional RV abnormalities and EP testing suggests potential for the use of MR imaging as a noninvasive method to estimate the individual risk of arrhythmia in patients with myotonic dystrophy.},

abstract={The effectiveness and relevance of independent acceptance testing was assessed by means of an audit of acceptance procedures for 17 MRI systems, with field strengths in the range 0.5-1.5 T, acquired over 8 years. Signal-to-noise ratio and geometric linearity were found to be the image quality parameters most likely to fall below acceptable or expected standards. These received confirmed successful corrective action in 69% of instances. Non-uniformity, ghosting and poor fat suppression were the next most common non-compliant parameters, but yielded less satisfactory outcomes. Spatial resolution was not found to be a sensitive parameter in determining acceptability. 49% of all non-compliant parameters received verifiable corrective attention. A schedule of actual acceptance criteria is presented and shown to be reasonable. Parameter failure rates were shown not to have improved with time. A safety audit of 11 of the installations revealed the most common failings to be inadequate suite layout and poor use of signs. The mean number of safety issues per installation identified as requiring attention was 5, from a questionnaire of 100 points. A number of anecdotal errors and omissions are reported. The data support the importance of an appropriate acceptance procedure for new clinical MRI equipment and for the involvement of a suitably qualified safety adviser on the project team from the outset.},

abstract={We report on the development of an algorithm to improve the registration of serial 3D MR breast images using combined global translation and rotation with locally varying parameters as geometric transformations. Several phantom and volunteer data sets were acquired and registered using mutual information as a similarity measure of the matching process. After applying a global translation by using a rigid matcher, optimum horizontal and vertical rotation angles were determined. In case of the phantom measurements, angle optimization was performed for each slice of the 3D data set of the phantom, which was deliberately shifted and rotated around different axes. In case of registration of volunteer data, optimum rotation parameters were calculated for pre-selected equidistant slices of the data set to speed up the calculation time. For slices located between and outside these support slices, the rotation angles were calculated by linear interpolation and extrapolation of the slope of the regression determined by the optimized angles of the support slices. The algorithm improves the registration of serial 3D MR data sets and represents a compromise between a rigid and an elastic 3D matching procedure.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate a velocity-encoded cine-MR (VEC-MR) sequence in measuring flow velocities up to two times the velocity encoding value (VENC) in a flow phantom and to validate the method for assessing poststenotic jet velocities in postoperative patients after aortic coarctation. In vitro, a flow phantom was used (0.5T; TR/TE: 51/8 ms, flip angle=30 degrees, FOV=280 mm, 128x256 matrix VENC 40 or 80 cm/s). On binary images, maximum flow velocities (V(max)) were calculated with a region of interest (ROI, 8 pixels). With aliasing, V(max) was calculated by VENC+(V(aliasing)). In vivo, 16 postoperative patients after aortic coarctation underwent double-oblique VEC-MR imaging through the aortic arch (ECG triggering, 16 phases/RR, TR=600-800 ms, flow-encoding cranio-caudal, VENC=2 m/s). Peak systolic velocities were measured and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) was performed. In vitro, there were excellent correlations for MR velocity measurements with and without aliasing ( r=0.99) and for true and MR-derived flow velocities ( r=0.99). In vivo, there was good correlation between VEC-MR and TTDE-assessed V(max) values in the aorta at the former coarctation site ( r=0.90, n=16). Aliasing occurred in 13 patients. VEC-MR is a useful modality for assessing jet velocities in the follow-up of patients after aortic coarctation. Despite of aliasing, accurate velocity measurements up to two times VENC are possible using binary images.},

abstract={RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVESCatheter-directed intraarterial (IA) injections of gadolinium contrast agents may be used during endovascular interventions with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Injection protocols require further validation. Using a flow phantom and swine, the authors aimed to (a) measure the optimal arterial gadolinium concentration (Gd]) required for MR angiography and (b) validate a proposed IA injection protocol for gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography.MATERIALS AND METHODSFor in vitro experiments, the authors placed a catheter in the aorta of an aorto-renal-iliac flow phantom. Injected Gd], injection rates, and aortic blood flow rates were varied independently for 36 separate IA gadolinium injections. The authors performed 2D and 3D MR angiography with a fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence. For subsequent in vivo experiments, they selectively placed catheters within the aorta, renal artery, or common iliac artery of three pigs. Injection rate and injected Gd] were varied. The authors performed 32 separate IA gadolinium injections for 2D MR angiography. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were compared for the various combinations of injection rate and injected Gd].RESULTSIn vitro, an arterial Gd] of 2%-4% produced an optimal SNR for 2D MR angiography, and 3%-5% was best for 3D MR angiography. In swine, an arterial Gd] of 1%-4% produced an optimal SNR. In the phantom and swine experiments, SNR was maintained at higher injection rates by inversely varying the injected Gd].CONCLUSIONDilute arterial Gd] is required for optimal IA gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. To maintain an optimal SNR, injection rates and injected Gd] should be varied inversely. The postulated injection protocol was validated.},

abstract={A detailed analysis procedure is described for evaluating rates of volumetric change in brain structures based on structural magnetic resonance (MR) images. In this procedure, a series of image processing tools have been employed to address the problems encountered in measuring rates of change based on structural MR images. These tools include an algorithm for intensity non-uniformity correction, a robust algorithm for three-dimensional image registration with sub-voxel precision and an algorithm for brain tissue segmentation. However, a unique feature in the procedure is the use of a fractional volume model that has been developed to provide a quantitative measure for the partial volume effect. With this model, the fractional constituent tissue volumes are evaluated for voxels at the tissue boundary that manifest partial volume effect, thus allowing tissue boundaries be defined at a sub-voxel level and in an automated fashion. Validation studies are presented on key algorithms including segmentation and registration. An overall assessment of the method is provided through the evaluation of the rates of brain atrophy in a group of normal elderly subjects for which the rate of brain atrophy due to normal aging is predictably small. An application of the method is given in Part II where the rates of brain atrophy in various brain regions are studied in relation to normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract={A study of the applicability of nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) to predict soft tissue deformation was validated with phase contrast magnetic resonance velocity imaging. A phantom of varying stiffness was placed in a special purpose, computer controlled MR compatible compression apparatus which provided precise, time varying compression with surface deformations on the order of 11%. The resulting motion was measured with MR velocity images acquired throughout the cycle of compression. The phantom geometry was modeled with a finite element mesh and the mechanical properties of the phantom material were measured and incorporated in the FEA model. The motion as calculated by the FEA model was compared to the motion measured with MRI and the results were found to vary with the material's Poisson's ratio and the coefficient of friction. A minimum difference was reached when the Poisson's ratio and coefficient of friction were set to 0.485 and 0.3, respectively. Under these conditions, the root mean square difference was found to be 14.4%.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to adapt the balloon model for BOLD-based MR signal changes to a magnetic field strength of 3T and to examine its validity. The simultaneous measurement of BOLD and diffusion-weighted BOLD responses was performed. The amplitude of the BOLD peak was found to be similar for all subjects when a short visual stimulus of 6 sec was used. The rise-time to the BOLD peak and the shape and depth of the poststimulus undershoot varied significantly. A fit of the experimental BOLD responses was found to be possible by use of parameters within a reasonable physiological range. The relations between these parameters and their influence on the modeled BOLD responses is discussed. A prediction of the balloon model is the occurrence of a BOLD overshoot, i.e., a lag between the changes of the blood volume and the blood flow after the start of the stimulation. Experimental evidence for the existence of a BOLD overshoot is presented.},

abstract={In an effort to develop MRI methods for the evaluation of tumor angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), MRI-derived cerebral blood volume (CBV) information has been compared to histologic measures of microvessel density (MVD). Although MVD is a standard marker of angiogenesis, it is not a direct correlate of the volume measurements made with MRI, and therefore inappropriate for the development and validation of the MR techniques. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop an approach by which MR measurements of CBV can be directly correlated. To this end, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI experiments were performed in six Fisher rats implanted with 9L gliosarcoma brain tumors. Subsequently, the circulation was perfused with a latex compound (Microfil), after which 50-microm tissue sections were analyzed for vessel count, diameter, and the fraction of area comprised of vessels. The results demonstrate that while fractional area (FA) does not provide a good measure of CBV, FA corrected for section thickness effects does. Whereas the FA in normal brain was found to be 13.03 +/- 1.83% the corrected FA, or fractional volume (FV), was 1.89 +/- 0.39%, a value in agreement with those reported in the literature for normal brain. Furthermore, while no significant difference was found between normal brain and tumor FA (P = 0.55), the difference was significant for FV (P = 0.036), as would be expected. And only with FV does a correlation with the MRI-derived CBV become apparent (r(S) = 0.74). There was strong correlation (r(s) = 0.886) between the tumor / normal blood volume ratios as estimated by each technique, although the MR-ratio (1.56 +/- 0.29) underestimated the histologic-ratio (2.35 +/- 0.75). Thus, the correlation of MRI CBV methods requires a measurement of fractional vessel area and correction of this area for section thickness effects. This new independent correlative measure should enable efficient and accurate progress in the development of MRI methods to evaluate tumor angiogenesis.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEWe sought to investigate whether the combination of conventional, diffusion-weighted, and perfusion-weighted MR imaging increases the diagnostic accuracy of balloon test occlusion of the internal carotid artery. We describe perfusion anomalies and patterns of enhancement seen in areas of altered brain perfusion during MR-monitored temporary balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery.METHODSNine patients underwent balloon occlusion testing under standard angiographic conditions with continuous clinical and EEG monitoring. One patient who failed the test by clinical criteria underwent an external carotid to internal carotid bypass operation, followed by a repeat balloon test occlusion, thereby bringing the total number of procedures to 10. Patients were further imaged at 1.5 T with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging as well as with conventional noncontrast and contrast-enhanced turbo fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1-weighted sequences.RESULTSSeven of 10 patients who tolerated unilateral carotid test occlusion without adverse clinical neurologic or EEG changes exhibited delayed first-pass transit of contrast material through the affected cerebral hemisphere, indicative of altered perfusion without significant concurrent cerebral blood flow or blood volume changes. Four of these patients and both symptomatic patients showed pial or subarachnoid contrast staining in areas of altered perfusion without abnormalities on diffusion-weighted images.CONCLUSIONOur findings indicate that MR perfusion-weighted imaging is safe and easily accomplished in a high-field-strength magnet and that contrast-enhanced turboFLAIR imaging may provide clinically useful MR imaging evidence of abnormal cerebral blood flow and subclinical ischemia.},

abstract={A magnetic resonance imaging projective velocity encoding sequence was used to determine the pulse-wave velocity in an artery model. To this end, a well-defined flow phantom simulating flow propagation in large arteries was used. In order to validate the measurement method in the presence of large reflected waves, these were deliberately created in the phantom. The projective sequence was applied to two measurement sites and the wave velocity was determined from the spatial and temporal separations of the foot of the velocity waveform. A theoretical model describing reflection and attenuation phenomena was compared with experimental velocity waveforms. The model showed that reflections and attenuation can explain the important changes in velocity waveforms. The model also confirmed that in the presence of reflecting waves, the foot of the waveform can be used as a characteristic point for measurements through changes in the waveform.},

abstract={Essential to the success of optimized thermal treatment during hyperthermia is accurate modelling. Advection of energy due to blood perfusion significantly affects the temperature. Without accurate estimates of the magnitude of the local tissue blood perfusion, accurate estimates of the temperature distribution can not be made. It is shown here that the blood mass flow rate per unit volume of tissue in the Pennes' bio-heat equation can be modelled using a relative perfusion index (RPI) determined with dynamic-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI). Temperature distributions in two patients treated with hyperthermia at Duke University Medical Center for high-grade leg tissue sarcomas are modelled, and the resultant temperatures are compared to measured temperatures using a non-invasive MR thermometry technique. Significant correlations are found between the DE-MRI perfusion images, the MR temperature images, and the numerical simulation of the temperature field. The correlation between DE-MRI measured values and advective heat loss in tissue is used to scale the perfusion distribution, thereby allowing the continuum model to account for the local thermal impact of vasculature in the tumour. Large vessels in tumour and neighbouring healthy tissue need to be taken into account in order to accurately describe the complete temperature distribution.},

abstract={Our objectives were to test the hypotheses that: 1) during shoulder motion, glenohumeral alignment differs between asymptomatic shoulders and those with symptomatic instability; 2) during magnetic resonance (MR)-monitored physical exam or stress testing, glenohumeral alignment differs between asymptomatic shoulders and those with instability; and 3) glenohumeral translation during MR stress testing correlates with findings of shoulder instability by clinical exam and exam under anesthesia (EUA). Using an open-configuration 0.5 T MR imaging (MRI) system, we studied symptomatic shoulders in 11 subjects and compared them to their contralateral asymptomatic shoulders. Each shoulder was studied during abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation to determine the humeral head position on the glenoid. An examiner also performed the MR stress test on each shoulder by applying manual force on the humeral head during imaging. All shoulders were assigned an instability grade from the MR stress test, and this grade was correlated with: 1) clinical exam grade assigned during preoperative assessment by an orthopedic surgeon and 2) intraoperative instability grade by EUA immediately preceding arthroscopy. With dynamic abduction and internal/external rotation, the humeral head remained centered on the glenoid in 9 of 11 shoulders, but in two subjects there were dramatic demonstrations of subluxation. With stress testing, a trend toward more joint laxity was demonstrated in symptomatic than in asymptomatic joints (P = 0.11). MR grading of instability correlated directly with clinical grading in six cases and underestimated the degree of instability relative to clinical exam in the other cases. MR instability grading systematically underestimated instability compared with EUA in 7 of the 10 cases that underwent surgical repair. We concluded that dynamic MR evaluation of glenohumeral alignment did not demonstrate abnormalities in symptomatic shoulders in 8 of 10 patients, whereas 2 patients showed dramatic findings of subluxation. Manual stress testing during dynamic MR examination showed a strong correlation with clinical instability grading. Dynamic shoulder MR examination during stress testing could, with further validation, become a useful adjunct to shoulder instability evaluations. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:748-756.},

abstract={Open magnetic resonance (MR) scanners allow MR-guided targeting of tumors, as well as temperature monitoring of radio frequency (RF) ablation. The proton frequency shift (PFS) technique, an accurate and fast imaging method for temperature quantification, was used to synthesize thermal maps after RF ablation in an open 0.5 T MR system under ex vivo and in vivo conditions. Calibration experiments with 1.5% agarose gel yielded a chemical shift factor of 0.011 +/- 0.001 ppm/ degrees C (r2 = 0.96). Three gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences were tested for thermal mapping by comparison with fiberoptic thermometer (Luxtron Model 760) readings. Temperature uncertainty decreased from high to low bandwidths (BW): +/-5.9 degrees C at BW = 15.6 kHz, +/-1.4 degrees C at BW = 3.9 kHz, and +/-0.8 degrees C at BW = 2.5 kHz. In vitro experiments (N = 9) in the paraspinal muscle yielded a chemical shift factor of 0.008 +/- 0.001 ppm/ degrees C. Temperature uncertainty was determined as +/-2.7 degrees C (BW = 3.9 kHz, TE = 19.3 msec). The same experiments carried out in the paraspinal muscle (N = 9) of a fully anesthetized pig resulted in a temperature uncertainty of +/-4.3 degrees C (BW = 3.9 kHz, TE = 19.3 msec), which is higher than it is in vitro conditions (P < 0.15). Quantitative temperature monitoring of RF ablation is feasible in a 0.5 T open-configured MR scanner under ex vivo and in vivo conditions using the PFS technique.},

abstract={PURPOSETo validate coronary sinus flow measurements for quantification of global left ventricular (LV) perfusion by means of velocity-encoded cine (VEC) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and flow probes.MATERIALS AND METHODSMeasurements of coronary sinus flow were performed in seven dogs by using VEC MR imaging at baseline, single coronary arterial stenosis, dipyridamole stress, and reactive hyperemia. These measurements were compared with flow probe measurements of coronary blood flow (CBF) in the left anterior descending coronary (LAD) and circumflex (CFX) arteries (CBF(LAD+CFX)) and coronary sinus. LV blood perfusion was calculated in milliliters per minute per gram from coronary sinus flow, and LV mass was obtained by using VEC and cine MR imaging. LV mass was validated at autopsy.RESULTSCBF(LAD+CFX) and coronary sinus flow at VEC MR imaging showed close correlation (r = 0.98, P: <.001). The difference between CBF(LAD+CFX) and MR coronary sinus flow was 3.1 mL/min +/- 8.5 (SD). LV mass at cine MR imaging was not significantly different from that at autopsy (73.2 g +/- 12.8 vs 69. 4 g +/- 12.8). At baseline, myocardial perfusion was 0.40 mL/min/g +/- 0.09 at VEC MR imaging, and CBF(LAD+CFX) was 0.44 mL/min/g +/- 0. 08 (not significant). Reactive hyperemia resulted in 2.7- and 2. 3-fold increases in coronary sinus flow at VEC MR imaging and flow probe CBF(LAD+CFX), respectively.CONCLUSIONVEC MR imaging has the potential to measure coronary sinus flow during different physiologic conditions and can serve as a noninvasive modality to quantify global LV perfusion in patients.},

The purpose of this study was to assess whether MR imaging measurements of coronary flow reserve in the left anterior descending artery are comparable with those obtained with PET in the corresponding territory.SUBJECTS AND METHODSMR imaging and PET flow measurements were obtained in 10 healthy volunteers. Blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending artery was measured with breath-hold velocity-encoded cine MR imaging before and after IV administration of dipyridamole. The coronary flow velocity reserve measured by MR imaging was compared with the myocardial perfusion reserve in the anterior myocardium quantified on using PET and (15)O-labeled water.RESULTSThe average flow velocity reserve in the left anterior descending artery measured on MR imaging was 2.44+/-1.14 in healthy volunteers, which was comparable with the myocardial perfusion reserve measured by PET (2.52+/-0.84). MR imaging and PET measurements of the coronary flow reserve showed a significant correlation (r = 0.79, p<0.01).CONCLUSIONMR imaging measurement of the flow velocity reserve in the proximal left anterior descending artery correlates well with the myocardial perfusion reserve obtained with PET and (15)O-labeled water.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSERecent positron emission tomography and single-photon emission CT studies using the Tower of London test have shown that brain activation during planning activities primarily resides in the prefrontal cortex. In this study, we adapted the Tower of London test for functional MR imaging.METHODSFor use with functional MR imaging, a block design of the test was created, in which planning stages were contrasted with counting of colored balls. For nine healthy participants, multisection echo-planar functional MR imaging was performed to assess brain activation based on changes in blood oxygen level. Activation maps for individual participants and a group average map were created.RESULTSIn the group average map, activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the cingulate cortex, the cuneus and precuneus, the supramarginal and angular gyrus in the parietal lobe, and the frontal opercular area of the insula was seen. These findings are in agreement with grouped data of previous positron emission tomography results. Functional MR imaging enabled us to investigate brain activation during planning activities with high spatial (and temporal) resolution in individual patients, showing that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was activated in all participants studied.CONCLUSIONPresented is a working functional MR imaging version of the planning task. The high sensitivity of functional MR imaging may allow the use of this test for patients with possible (pre)frontal disorders.},

abstract={Contrast enhancement during the dynamic MR imaging is important for the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not a timing examination with a injection of a 1.0-mL bolus of gadopentetate dimeglumine into the antecubital vein followed by rapid dynamic scanning and measurement of signal intensity of the aorta could help to obtain proper arterial-dominant phase images for the characterization of focal hepatic lesions during subsequent multiphase dynamic MR imaging. The imaging delay to acquisition of the first gadolinium-enhanced image for multiphase dynamic MR imaging was set to equal the time to peak aortic enhancement during the test examination. The first contrast-enhanced images of 80 patients with 160 focal liver lesions (hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 79; cavernous hemangioma, n = 51; metastatic tumor, n = 30) were then retrospectively reviewed. Peak aortic enhancement occurred between 10 and 28 seconds (mean, 16.5 seconds +/- 3.1) after starting the infusion of contrast material in 80 patients during the test-examination. Depending on the findings of intrahepatic vascular enhancement on the full-scale dynamic images, hepatic arterial phase (n = 11, 14%) or sinusoid phase (n = 65, 81%) imaging was obtained during the first gadolinium-enhanced acquisition in 76 (95%) of 80 patients. Three different lesions were well characterized and easily distinguished from each other (p < .0001) on the first-phase images depending on their enhancement pattern. In the majority of patients, timing examination with test-bolus injection was helpful in obtaining qualified images for the characterization of various focal lesions.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEOur purpose was to show changes in the diameter of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by using high-resolution MR imaging in patients with chronic internal carotid artery occlusion after IV administered acetazolamide challenge. Changes in blood flow velocity of the basal cerebral arteries are thought to correlate with changes of cerebral blood flow. Changes in the diameter of the basal cerebral arteries, however, might influence the validity of transcranial Doppler measurements.METHODSEight patients with internal carotid artery occlusion who were undergoing acetazolamide testing for assessment of cerebrovascular vasomotor reactivity were included in the study. Blood flow velocities of both MCAs were measured with transcranial Doppler sonography before and 25 minutes after the administration of acetazolamide. Before and 15 minutes after the administration of medication, MR imaging was performed contralateral to the occlusion side. A T2-weighted turbo-gradient spin-echo sequence was chosen to show a cross section of the M1 segment in high resolution (pixels, 0.27 x 0.29 mm). Based on interpolated data, the smallest and greatest MCA diameters were determined.RESULTSWe did not find changes in the diameter of the MCA after acetazolamide provocation testing with high-resolution MR imaging in patients with occlusive extracranial carotid artery disease.CONCLUSIONThe results of our study support the hypothesis that changes in MCA flow velocity measured by transcranial Doppler sonography reflect relative changes in cerebral blood flow after acetazolamide provocation testing.},

abstract={In MRI tagging, magnetic tags-spatially encoded magnetic saturation planes-are created within tissues acting as temporary markers. Their deformation pattern provides useful qualitative and quantitative information about the functional properties of underlying tissue and allows non-invasive analysis of mechanical function. The measured displacement at a given tag point contains only unidirectional information; in order to track the full 3D motion, these data have to be combined with information from other orthogonal tag sets over all time frames. Here, we provide a method to describe the motion of the heart using a four-dimensional tensor product of B-splines. In vivo validation of this tracking algorithm is performed using different tagging sets on the same heart. Using the validation results, the appropriate control point density was determined for normal cardiac motion tracking. Since our motion fields are parametric and based on an image plane based Cartesian coordinate system, trajectories or other derived values (velocity, acceleration, strains ...) can be calculated for any desired point within the volume spanned by the control points. This method does not rely on specific chamber geometry, so the motion of any tagged structure can be tracked. Examples of displacement and strain analysis for both ventricles are also presented.},

abstract={A high-resolution three-dimensional surface gradient coil set was used to obtain magnetic resonance (MR) images of breast specimens, using a gradient-echo pulse sequence (TR/TE 1000/8 msec, flip angle 75 degrees), with 117 micrometer in-plane resolution and 1 mm slice thickness. Breast tissues were obtained from one autopsy and three surgical specimens. High-resolution breast MR images and histopathology sections (7 micrometer thickness) were acquired in the same anatomical plane. Radiographs were acquired of the sliced specimens (approximately 5 mm thick) so that images from all three methods could be correlated. It was found that in vitro high-resolution breast MRI correlated well with low-resolution microscopic histology, demonstrating normal anatomy (lobules, ducts, connective tissue strands, blood vessels) and pathology (tumor content, margins, and presence of microcalcifications) of the breast more clearly than conventional pre-gadolinium breast MRI. High-resolution breast MRI may improve specificity, when added to a conventional breast MRI protocol.},

abstract={OBJECTIVETo evaluate the reliability of temporal and frontal functional MRI (fMRI) activation for the assessment of language dominance, as compared with the Wada test.PATIENTS AND METHODSTen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were studied using blood oxygen level dependent fMRI and echoplanar imaging (1.5-T). Three tasks were used: semantic verbal fluency, covert sentence repetition, and story listening. Data were analyzed using pixel by pixel autocorrelation and cross-correlation. fMRI laterality indices were defined for several regions of interest as the ratio (L - R)/(L + R), L being the number of activated voxels in the left hemisphere and R in the right hemisphere. Wada laterality indices were defined as the difference in the percentages of errors in language tests between left and right carotid injections.RESULTSSemantic verbal fluency: The asymmetry of frontal activation was correlated with Wada laterality indices. The strongest correlation was observed in the precentral/middle frontal gyrus/inferior frontal sulcus area. Story listening: The asymmetry of frontal, but not temporal, activation was correlated with Wada laterality indices. Covert sentence repetition: No correlation was observed.CONCLUSIONSThere was a good congruence between hemispheric dominance for language as assessed with the Wada test and fMRI laterality indices in the frontal but not in the temporal lobes. The story listening and the covert sentence repetition tasks increased the sensitivity of detection of posterior language sites that may be useful for brain lesion surgery.},
