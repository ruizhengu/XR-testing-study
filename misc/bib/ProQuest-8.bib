abstract={The major problems related to structural control and monitoring systems are the challenges involved with the installation of traditional transducers, the number of transducers required to obtain the desired structural responses, and the computation effort and time required to analyze, process, and post-process the recorded signals. Non-contact measurements employing digital image correlation (DIC) techniques have become popular in control engineering in recent years. However, it can only be used on certain types of members with a narrow frequency range, minor deflections, and a slower image frame rate. This study aims at determining a in-plane measurement of a five-story steel frame controlled with magnetorheological dampers (MR) on a shaking table using the streamed DIC technique employing a template matching algorithm. The MR dampers (Passive-ON and Passive-OFF) are involved in varying the characteristic of the structural response and therefore assess the accuracy and flexibility of the proposed DIC technique. A high level of precision was achieved for all response quantities for each image. The measurements of acceleration, displacement, velocity, inter-story drift of the floors, and column base strains of the structure subjected to high-intensity bi-directional ground motions are obtained and compared with results obtained from traditional transducers. The shaking table results specified the efficiency and precision of the proposed DIC system in monitoring the structural responses compared to the noisy transducer responses, which emphasized the potential of using this technique for monitoring, control, and reconnaissance of a wide range of structures during and after extreme events.},

abstract={MR images based on phase contrast images have gained clinical interest as an in vivo tool for assessing anatomical and histological findings. The globus pallidus is an area of major iron metabolism and storage in the brain tissue. Calcium, another important metal in the body, is frequently deposited in the globus pallidus as well. Recently, we observed dense paramagnetic deposition with paradoxical calcifications in the globus pallidus and putamen. In this work, we explore detailed MR findings on these structures, and the histological source of the related findings using ex vivo CT and MR images. Ex vivo MR was obtained with a maximum 100 μm3 isotropic resolution using a 15.2 T MR system. 3D gradient echo images and quantitative susceptibility mapping were used because of their good sensitivity to metallic deposition, high signal‐to‐noise ratio, and excellent contrast to iron and calcium. We found dense paramagnetic deposition along the perforating arteries in the globus pallidus. This paramagnetic deposition was hyperdense on ex vivo CT scans. Histological studies confirmed this finding, and simultaneous deposition of iron and calcium, although more iron dominant, was observed along the vessel walls of the globus pallidus. This was an exclusive finding for the penetrating arteries of the globus pallidus. Thus, our results suggest that several strong and paradoxical paramagnetic sources at the globus pallidus can be associated with vascular degeneration.},

abstract={As one of the most promising smart materials, magnetorheological (MR) gels have been widely applied in the vibration mitigation of engineering structures. An accurate and effective model for MR gels is of great significance for its in-depth research and engineering application. Existing models for MR materials mainly follow the magnetic dipole theory used for MR fluid, but this theory takes no account of the particle size and, thus, cannot apply to MR gels with a relatively higher volume fraction of particles. In this paper, a micromechanical model for MR gels was proposed and experimentally verified based on the planar current loop model. Firstly, high-performance MR gels were prepared, and basic performance characterizations, including the magnetization property and the sedimentation stability, were carried out. Then the magnetic energy of particles calculated by the magnetic dipole model and the planar current loop model were compared, and the micromechanical model of MR gels was proposed based on the planar current loop model. In the parameter determination process, the data obtained by magnetization tests of the particles were fitted to form the magnetization curve with higher accuracy. Finally, the yield shear stresses of the prepared MR gels were obtained by property tests, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed micromechanical model were verified by comparing the test data with the theoretical values calculated by the proposed model.},

abstract={BACKGROUNDIn patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, tumor grading constitutes a decisive factor to determine the best treatment decision. Tumor grading is obtained by pathological work-up after focal biopsies. Deep learning (DL)-based imaging analysis may pose an alternative way to characterize STS tissue. In this work, we sought to non-invasively differentiate tumor grading into low-grade (G1) and high-grade (G2/G3) STS using DL techniques based on MR-imaging.METHODSContrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated (T1FSGd) MRI sequences and fat-saturated T2-weighted (T2FS) sequences were collected from two independent retrospective cohorts (training: 148 patients, testing: 158 patients). Tumor grading was determined following the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group in pre-therapeutic biopsies. DL models were developed using transfer learning based on the DenseNet 161 architecture.RESULTSThe T1FSGd and T2FS-based DL models achieved area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.75 and 0.76 on the test cohort, respectively. T1FSGd achieved the best F1-score of all models (0.90). The T2FS-based DL model was able to significantly risk-stratify for overall survival. Attention maps revealed relevant features within the tumor volume and in border regions.CONCLUSIONSMRI-based DL models are capable of predicting tumor grading with good reproducibility in external validation.},

abstract={Consumer Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers a powerful, immersive medium for scalable dissemination of mental health interventions. Decades of research has shown VR exposure therapy to be efficacious in the treatment of anxiety disorders and that the fear reduction generalizes to real-world stimuli. Many studies also report continued improvement over time, after discontinuing VR use. The lowered threshold hypothesis states that this continued improvement is moderated by lowering the threshold to conduct subsequent in-vivo exposure. The current study is the first to formally test this hypothesis, using data from a recent trial on automated VR exposure therapy for spider phobia, in which participants (n = 49) were followed for 1 year, completing assessments 1 week, 3 and 12 months post-treatment. The assessment included validated self-report of phobia symptoms, a standardized behavioral approach test featuring a real spider, and a questionnaire for self-reporting frequency of in-vivo exposures since last assessment. Number of in-vivo exposures was found to be independently associated with greater symptom decrease in longitudinal outcome models. In sequential structural equation models, immediate post-treatment symptom reduction was associated with subsequent in-vivo exposures, which in turn was associated with continued symptom reduction. However, this applied only to self-reported phobia symptoms (not behavioral avoidance) and no associations were found past 3 months. Our findings offer preliminary, partial support for the lowered threshold hypothesis, suggesting that VR exposure interventions may benefit from including explicit in-virtuo to in-vivo transitioning components.},

abstract={The primary objective of cancer intervention is the selective removal of malignant cells while conserving surrounding healthy tissues. However, the accessibility, size and shape of the cancer can make achieving appropriate margins a challenge. One minimally invasive treatment option for these clinical cases is interstitial needle based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU). In this work, we develop a finite element model (FEM) capable of simulating continuous rotation of a directional NBTU applicator. The developed model was used to simulate the thermal deposition for different rotation trajectories. The actual thermal deposition patterns for the simulated trajectories were then evaluated using magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) in a porcine skin gelatin phantom. An MRI-compatible robot was used to control the rotation motion profile of the physical NBTU applicator to match the simulated trajectory. The model showed agreement when compared to experimental measurements with Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.839 when comparing temperature fields within an area of 12.6 mm radius from the ultrasound applicator. The average temperature error along a 6.3 mm radius profile from the applicator was Formula Omitted]. The model was able to compute 1 s of thermal deposition by the applicator in 0.2 s on average with a 0.1 mm spatial resolution and 0.5 s time steps. The developed simulation demonstrates performance suitable for real-time control which may enable robotically-actuated closed-loop conformal tumor ablation.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a new, open‐source MR‐compatible device capable of assessing unipedal and bipedal lower extremity movement with minimal head motion and high test–retest reliability. To evaluate the prototype, 20 healthy adults participated in two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits, separated by 2–6 months, in which they performed a visually guided dorsiflexion/plantar flexion task with their left foot, right foot, and alternating feet. Dependent measures included: evoked blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) signal in the motor network, head movement associated with dorsiflexion/plantar flexion, the test–retest reliability of these measurements. Left and right unipedal movement led to a significant increase in BOLD signal compared to rest in the medial portion of the right and left primary motor cortex (respectively), and the ipsilateral cerebellum (FWE corrected, p 0.75) and the angular displacement of the ankle joint (ICC: 0.842). This bipedal device can robustly isolate activity in the motor network during alternating plantarflexion and dorsiflexion with minimal head movement, while providing high test–retest reliability. Ultimately, these data and open‐source building instructions will provide a new, economical tool for investigators interested in evaluating brain function resulting from lower extremity movement.},

abstract={We use ten common macroeconomic variables to test for the predictability of the quarterly growth rate of house price index (HPI) in the United States during 1975:Q1–2018:Q2. We extend the instrumental variable based Wald statistic (IVX-KMS) proposed by Kostakis, Magdalinos, and Stamatogiannis to a new instrumental variable based Wald statistic (IVX-AR) which accounts for serial correlation and heteroscedasticity in the error terms of the linear predictive regression model. Simulation results show that the proposed IVX-AR exhibits excellent size control regardless of the degree of serial correlation in the error terms and the persistency in the predictive variables, while IVX-KMS displays severe size distortions. The empirical results indicate that the percentage of residential fixed investment in GDP is fairly a robust predictor of the growth rate of HPI. However, other macroeconomic variables’ strong predictive ability detected by IVX-KMS is likely to be driven by the highly correlated error terms in the predictive regressions and thus becomes insignificant when the proposed IVX-AR method is implemented.

abstract={Mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is important for human thermal comfort indexes, but is difficult to determine. Tmrt was calculated from measured temperatures of buildings and vegetation surfaces in urban scenarios along with meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity and global radiation). The method can be used for experimental work in urban settings without the use of four-flux net radiometers. Tmrt for different positions in the urban canyon can be calculated. A software package named Mr.T was developed which allows determining Tmrt from data input manually or from EXCEL spreadsheets. The software was validated in two urban settings: in Tel Aviv University and a nearby urban canyon in summer and in the old city quarter of Beer Sheva at the end of winter. Results were close to those obtained with a four-flux net radiometer. Differences in calculated and measured fluxes are discussed as well as sources of errors in the calculations. Assumption of clear skies for the computation of atmospheric radiation did not introduce significant errors. A priori values of albedo and emissivity of the different urban surfaces can have large effects on fluxes and radiant temperatures, and the use of tables of those values is probably a large source of uncertainty when using the calculation procedure. In conclusion, the software developed can be a significant tool for the study of thermal comfort conditions in urban settings.},

abstract={After the failure of a cantilever retaining wall with counterfort on the Brenner Autobahn, intensive investigation of existing structures showed considerable corrosion damage to cantilever walls with and without counterforts, at the location of construction and day joints. This is difficult to detect and assess due to the placing of the main reinforcement at the back of the construction. The present paper presents a monitoring concept, which enables detection of corrosion damage and also provides a gain of information about the behaviour of the structure. The basis for this concept is the installation of inclination and strain gauges on the front of a retaining wall. In order to explain the functioning of the concept, a rudimentary cantilever model of the effect of corrosion damage is first described. Then the results and findings from a test series with artificial corrosion representation to reinforced concrete structures to validate the presented monitoring concept is described.Alternate abstract:Nach dem Versagensfall einer Spornmauer auf der Brennerautobahn zeigte sich im Zuge intensiver Bestandserfassungen, dass vor allem im Bereich der Arbeits‐ und Betonierfugen von Winkelstütz‐ und Spornmauern erhebliche Korrosionsschäden vorliegen können. Diese sind aufgrund der Lage der Hauptbewehrung an der Hinterseite der Konstruktion schwierig zu erfassen und zu beurteilen. In vorliegendem Beitrag soll ein Monitoringkonzept vorgestellt werden, das die Erfassung von Korrosionsschäden ermöglicht und zudem auch einen Informationsgewinn in Bezug auf das Bauwerksverhalten aufweist. Die Grundlage für ein derartiges Konzept bildet die Anbringung von Neigungs‐ und Dehnungsaufnehmern an der Vorderseite eines Stützbauwerks. Um die Funktionsweise dieses Konzepts zu veranschaulichen, wird einleitend an einem rudimentären Stabmodell der Einfluss einer Korrosionsschädigung auf das Bauwerksverhalten aufgezeigt. Anschließend werden die Ergebnisse und Erkenntnisse aus einer Versuchsreihe zur künstlichen Korrosionsnachbildung bei Stahlbetonbauwerken zur Validierung des vorgestellten Monitoringkonzepts ausgeführt.},

abstract={The VERDICT framework for modelling diffusion MRI data aims to relate parameters from a biophysical model to histological features used for tumour grading in prostate cancer. Validation of the VERDICT model is necessary for clinical use. This study compared VERDICT parameters obtained ex vivo with histology in five specimens from radical prostatectomy. A patient‐specific 3D‐printed mould was used to investigate the effects of fixation on VERDICT parameters and to aid registration to histology. A rich diffusion data set was acquired in each ex vivo prostate before and after fixation. At both time points, data were best described by a two‐compartment model: the model assumes that an anisotropic tensor compartment represents the extracellular space and a restricted sphere compartment models the intracellular space. The effect of fixation on model parameters associated with tissue microstructure was small. The patient‐specific mould minimized tissue deformations and co‐localized slices, so that rigid registration of MRI to histology images allowed region‐based comparison with histology. The VERDICT estimate of the intracellular volume fraction corresponded to histological indicators of cellular fraction, including high values in tumour regions. The average sphere radius from VERDICT, representing the average cell size, was relatively uniform across samples. The primary diffusion direction from the extracellular compartment of the VERDICT model aligned with collagen fibre patterns in the stroma obtained by structure tensor analysis. This confirmed the biophysical relationship between ex vivo VERDICT parameters and tissue microstructure from histology.},

abstract={Purpose To validate three widely-used acceleration methods in four-dimensional (4D) flow cardiac MR; segmented 4D-spoiled-gradient-echo (4D-SPGR), 4D-echo-planar-imaging (4D-EPI), and 4D-k-t Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique (4D-k-t BLAST). Materials and Methods Acceleration methods were investigated in static/pulsatile phantoms and 25 volunteers on 1.5 Tesla MR systems. In phantoms, flow was quantified by 2D phase-contrast (PC), the three 4D flow methods and the time-beaker flow measurements. The later was used as the reference method. Peak velocity and flow assessment was done by means of all sequences. For peak velocity assessment 2D PC was used as the reference method. For flow assessment, consistency between mitral inflow and aortic outflow was investigated for all pulse-sequences. Visual grading of image quality/artifacts was performed on a four-point-scale (0=no artifacts; 3=nonevaluable). Results For the pulsatile phantom experiments, the mean error for 2D PC=1.0±1.1%, 4D-SPGR=4.9±1.3%, 4D-EPI=7.6±1.3% and 4D-k-t BLAST=4.4±1.9%. In vivo, acquisition time was shortest for 4D-EPI (4D-EPI=8±2min versus 4D-SPGR=9±3min, P<0.05 and 4D-k-t BLAST=9±3min, P=0.29). 4D-EPI and 4D-k-t BLAST had minimal artifacts, while for 4D-SPGR, 40% of aortic valve/mitral valve (AV/MV) assessments scored 3 (nonevaluable). Peak velocity assessment using 4D-EPI demonstrated best correlation to 2D PC (AV:r=0.78, P<0.001; MV:r=0.71, P<0.001). Coefficient of variability (CV) for net forward flow (NFF) volume was least for 4D-EPI (7%) (2D PC:11%, 4D-SPGR: 29%, 4D-k-t BLAST: 30%, respectively). Conclusion In phantom, all 4D flow techniques demonstrated mean error of less than 8%. 4D-EPI demonstrated the least susceptibility to artifacts, good image quality, modest agreement with the current reference standard for peak intra-cardiac velocities and the highest consistency of intra-cardiac flow quantifications.

abstract={Purpose Ongoing discussions occur to translate the safety restrictions on MR scanners from specific absorption rate (SAR) to thermal dose. Therefore, this research focuses on the accuracy of thermal simulations in human subjects during an MR exam, which is fundamental information in that debate. Methods Radiofrequency (RF) heating experiments were performed on the calves of 13 healthy subjects using a dedicated transmit-receive coil while monitoring the temperature with proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) thermometry. Subject-specific models and one generic model were used for electromagnetic and thermal simulations using Pennes' bioheat equation, with the blood equilibration constant equaling zero. The simulations were subsequently compared with the experimental results. Results The mean Formulaomitted] equaled 15 mu T in the center slice of all volunteers, and 95% of the voxels had errors smaller than 2.8 mu T between the simulation and measurement. The intersubject variation in RF power to achieve the required Formulaomitted] was 11%. The resulting intersubject variation in median temperature rise was 14%. Thermal simulations underestimated the median temperature increase on average, with 34% in subject-specific models and 28% in the generic model. Conclusions Although thermal measures are directly coupled to tissue damage and therefore suitable for RF safety assessment, insecurities in the applied thermal modeling limit their estimation accuracy.

abstract={Goal: A novel magnetic resonance (MR) compatible accelerometer for respiratory motion sensing (MARMOT) is developed as a surrogate of the vendors' pneumatic belts. We aim to model and correct respiratory motion for free-breathing thoracic-abdominal MR imaging and to simplify patient installation. Methods: MR compatibility of MARMOT sensors was assessed in phantoms and its motion modeling/correction efficacy was demonstrated on 21 subjects at 3 T. Respiration was modeled and predicted from MARMOT sensors and pneumatic belts, based on real-time images and a regression method. The sensor accuracy was validated by comparing motion errors in the liver/kidney. Sensor data were also exploited as inputs for motion-compensated reconstruction of free-breathing cardiac cine MR images. Multiple and single sensor placement strategies were compared. Results: The new sensor is compatible with the MR environment. The average motion modeling and prediction errors with MARMOT sensors and with pneumatic belts were comparable (liver and kidney) and were below 2 mm with all tested configurations (belts, multiple/single MARMOT sensor). Motion corrected cardiac cine images were of improved image quality, as assessed by an entropy metric (p <; 10-6), with all tested configurations. Expert readings revealed multiple MARMOT sensors were the best (p <; 0.03) and the single MARMOT sensor was similar to the belts (nonsignificant in two of the three readers). Conclusion: The proposed sensor can model and predict respiratory motion with sufficient accuracy to allow free-breathing MR imaging strategy. Significance: It provides an alternative sensor solution for the respiratory motion problem during MR imaging and may improve the convenience of patient setup.},

abstract={Improved real-time cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) sequences have currently been introduced, but so far only limited practical experience exists. This study aimed at image reconstruction optimization and clinical validation of a new highly accelerated real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE sequence. Left ventricular (LV) short-axis stacks of a real-time free-breathing SPARSE-SENSE sequence with high spatiotemporal resolution and of a standard segmented cine SSFP sequence were acquired at 1.5 T in 11 volunteers and 15 patients. To determine the optimal iterations, all volunteers' SPARSE-SENSE images were reconstructed using 10-200 iterations, and contrast ratios, image entropies, and reconstruction times were assessed. Subsequently, the patients' SPARSE-SENSE images were reconstructed with the clinically optimal iterations. LV volumetric values were evaluated and compared between both sequences. Sufficient image quality and acceptable reconstruction times were achieved when using 80 iterations. Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok regression showed good agreement for all volumetric parameters. 80 iterations are recommended for iterative SPARSE-SENSE image reconstruction in clinical routine. Real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE yielded comparable volumetric results as the current standard SSFP sequence. Due to its intrinsic low image acquisition times, real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE imaging with iterative image reconstruction seems to be an attractive alternative for LV function analysis. times A highly accelerated real-time CMR sequence using SPARSE-SENSE was evaluated. times SPARSE-SENSE allows free breathing in real-time cardiac cine imaging. times For clinically optimal SPARSE-SENSE image reconstruction, 80 iterations are recommended. times Real-time SPARSE-SENSE imaging yielded comparable volumetric results as the reference SSFP sequence. times The fast SPARSE-SENSE sequence is an attractive alternative to standard SSFP sequences.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION Identification of cancer biomarkers that inform clinical decisions and reduce the use of ineffective therapies is a major goal of precision oncology. An abnormal splice variant of the androgen receptor, AR-V7, was recently found to confer resistance to novel hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but did not negatively affect responses to taxane chemotherapies, suggesting that early use of chemotherapy may be a more effective option for AR-V7(+) patients. METHODS We calculated the cost savings of performing AR-V7 testing in mCRPC patients prior to starting abiraterone/enzalutamide (and avoiding these drugs in AR-V7(+) men) versus treating all mCRPC patients empirically with abiraterone/enzalutamide (without use of the biomarker). RESULTS We determined that AR-V7 testing would result in substantial cost savings as long as the true prevalence of AR-V7 was >5%. In our prior studies, we estimated that approximately 30% of mCRPC patients may have detectable AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In this population, upfront testing of AR-V7 status (at a price of $1,000 per test) would result in a net cost savings of $150 Million in the United States per year. CONCLUSIONS AR-V7 testing in mCRPC patients would be cost-beneficial when considering the current price of treatment, and may reduce the ineffective use of abiraterone/enzalutamide, leading to a significant net cost savings to the healthcare system. Clinical-grade AR-V7 testing is currently available at our institution. Prostate 76:1484-1490, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={We propose outlier a robust and distribution-free test for the explosive AR(1) model with intercept based on simplicial depth. In this model, simplicial depth reduces to counting the cases where three residuals have alternating signs. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is given by a specific Gaussian process. Conditions for the consistency are given, and the power of the test at finite samples is compared with alternative tests. The new test outperforms these tests in the case of skewed errors and outliers. Finally, we apply the method to crack growth data and compare the results with an OLS approach.},

abstract={Purpose To determine the test-retest reproducibility of neurochemical concentrations obtained with a highly optimized, short-echo, single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) pulse sequence at 3T and 7T using state-of-the-art hardware. Methods A semi-LASER sequence (echo time=26-28 ms) was used to acquire spectra from the posterior cingulate and cerebellum at 3T and 7T from six healthy volunteers who were scanned four times weekly on both scanners. Spectra were quantified with LCModel. Results More neurochemicals were quantified with mean Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) less than or equal to 20% at 7T than at 3T despite comparable frequency-domain signal-to-noise ratio. Whereas CRLBs were lower at 7T (P<0.05), between-session coefficients of variance (CVs) were comparable at the two fields with 64 transients. Five metabolites were quantified with between-session CVs less than or equal to 5% at both fields. Analysis of subspectra showed that a minimum achievable CV was reached with a lower number of transients at 7T for multiple metabolites and that between-session CVs were lower at 7T than at 3T with fewer than 64 transients. Conclusion State-of-the-art MRS methodology allows excellent reproducibility for many metabolites with 5-min data averaging on clinical 3T hardware. Sensitivity and resolution advantages at 7T are important for weakly represented metabolites, short acquisitions, and small volumes of interest. Magn Reson Med 76:1083-1091, 2016.},

abstract={For quality assurance and adaptive radiotherapy, validation of the actual delivered dose is crucial. Intrafractional anatomy changes cannot be captured satisfactorily during treatment with hitherto available imaging modalitites. Consequently, dose calculations are based on the assumption of static anatomy throughout the treatment. However, intra- and interfraction anatomy is dynamic and changes can be significant. In this paper, we investigate the use of an MR-linac as a dose tracking modality for the validation of treatments in abdominal targets where both respiratory and long-term peristaltic and drift motion occur. The on-line MR imaging capability of the modality provides the means to perform respiratory gating of both delivery and acquisition yielding a model-free respiratory motion management under free breathing conditions. In parallel to the treatment, the volumetric patient anatomy was captured and used to calculate the applied dose. Subsequently, the individual doses were warped back to the planning grid to obtain the actual dose accumulated over the entire treatment duration. Ultimately, the planned dose was validated by comparison with the accumulated dose. Representative for a site subject to breathing modulation, two kidney cases (25 Gy target dose) demonstrated the working principle on volunteer data and simulated delivery. The proposed workflow successfully showed its ability to track local dosimetric changes. Integration of the on-line anatomy information could reveal local dose variations -2.3-1.5 Gy in the target volume of a volunteer dataset. In the adjacent organs at risk, high local dose errors ranging from -2.5 to 1.9 Gy could be traced back.},

abstract={Purpose To compare the vessel size and the cerebral blood volume in human gliomas with histopathology. Vessel size imaging (VSI) is a dynamic susceptibility contrast method for the assessment of the vessel size in normal and pathological tissue. Previous publications in rodents showed a satisfactory conformity with the vessel size derived from histopathology. To assess the clinical value, further, the progression-free interval was determined and correlated. Materials and Methods Twenty-five gliomas (WHO grade °II n = 10], °III n = 3], °IV n = 12]) were prospectively included and received a stereotaxic biopsy after VSI. The vessel size and the cerebral blood volume (CBV) were calculated in regions of interest at the tumor edge and correlated with the vessel size measured by histopathology. Results Both VSI and CBV showed a good correlation with the vessel size in histopathology (up to r = 0.84, P < 0.001, and r = 0.62, P < 0.001, respectively). Slope and offset of the linear regression (y = 0.77x + 0.36 µm) suggest that the size of normal capillaries is overestimated with VSI, while for grossly enlarged vessels an underestimation occurs. Both VSI and CBV were negatively correlated with the progression-free interval (r = -0.57, P = 0.008, and r = -0.50, P = 0.025, respectively). Conclusion The correlation between VSI and vessel size from histopathology is in good accordance with the animal studies. The overestimation of small capillary sizes is also known from the animal trials. Vessel size and CBV showed similar results, both for the correlation with the histopathological vessel size and the progression-free interval. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;42:1117-1125.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:3D FSE T1WI has recently been used for carotid plaque imaging, given the potential advantages in contrast and spatial resolutions. However, its diagnostic performance remains unclear. Hence, we compared the ability of this technique to readily assess plaque characteristics with that of conventional images and validated the results with histologic classification.MATERIALS AND METHODS:We prospectively examined 34 patients with carotid stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy by using 1.5T scanners and obtained 3D-FSE T1WI and 2D spin-echo T1WI scans. After generating reformatted images obtained from the 3D-FSE T1-weighted images, we calculated the contrast ratios for the plaques and the adjacent muscles and compared these findings with the pathologic classifications.RESULTS:Carotid plaques were histologically classified as types VII, VIII, IV-V, or VI. With 3D-FSE T1WI, the range of contrast ratios for each classification was the following: 0.94-0.97 (median, 0.95), 0.95-1.29 (median, 1.10), 1.33-1.54 (median, 1.42), and 1.53-2.12 (median, 1.80), respectively. With 2D imaging, the range of contrast ratios for each classification was the following: 0.79-1.02 (median, 0.90), 0.88-1.19 (median, 1.01), 1.17-1.46 (median, 1.23), and 1.55-2.51 (median, 2.07), respectively. Results were significantly different among the 4 groups (P < .001). Sensitivity and specificity for discriminating vulnerable plaques (IV-VI) from stable plaques (VII, VIII) were both 100% for the 3D technique and 100% and 91%, respectively, for the 2D technique.CONCLUSIONS:3D-FSE T1WI accurately characterizes intraplaque components of the carotid artery, with excellent sensitivity and specificity compared with those of 2D-T1WI.},

From this perspective, the paper summarizes the results of an experimental activity aimed to compare the effectiveness of four different semi-active control algorithms on a structural mock up representative of a class of structural systems particularly prone to seismic actions. The controlled structure is a near full scale 2-story steel frame, equipped with two semi-active bracing systems including two magnetorheological dampers designed and manufactured in Europe. A set of earthquake records has been applied at the base of the structure, by utilizing a shaking table facility. Experimental results are compared in terms of displacements, absolute accelerations and energy dissipation capability. A further analysis on the percentage incidence of undesired and/or unpredictable operations corresponding to each algorithm gives an insight on some factors affecting the reliability and, in turn, the real effectiveness of semi-active structural control systems.},

abstract={The EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI is distorted by a number of artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts, associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat, reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However, a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused by the Helium cooling pump, and propose a method for its reduction and respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since the Helium cooling pump artefact was found to be repetitive, an average template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact spectral peaks by 95 plus or minus 2 % while the background spectral amplitude within those peaks was reduced by only -5 plus or minus 4 %. Although the Helium cooling pump should ideally be switched off during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post processing.},

abstract={Family-centred service (FCS) is widely accepted now as best practice in paediatric rehabilitation. The Measure of Processes of Care-20 items set (MPOC-20) is a valid and reliable self-report measure of parents' perceptions of the extent to which health services are family-centred. Arabic-translated and validated version of the MPOC-20 (AR-MPOC-20) is used to examine Jordanian families' perception of service providers' caregiving behaviours as they receive rehabilitation services for their children with cerebral palsy (CP). Parents of 114 children with CP who are receiving services at different settings in Jordan were interviewed using the AR-MPOC-20. Participating children aged 4.1 +/- 4.4 years, 53.5% were males. Children varied across gross motor functional classification system (GMFCS). Parents were mostly mothers (76.3%), with at least high school education (71.9%). Factor analyses of the AR-MPOC-20 yielded a five-factor solution with items loaded differently from the original measure. All items correlated best and significantly with their own Arabic scale score (rs: 0.91-0.26, P < 0.01). Internal consistency values of AR-MPOC-20 scales were acceptable (Cronbach's a: 0.69-0.82). Scale 'Providing Written Information' has the lowest average score (1.9 +/- 1.6), while scale 'Respectful & Coordinated Care' has the highest average score (5.2 +/- 1.5). The AR-MPOC-20 is found to be a valid and reliable measure for use with Arabic-Jordanian families of children with CP. FCS is not yet well implemented in Jordan, with parents reporting more need for information about their children's health and available services. Service providers are encouraged to apply FCS in paediatric rehabilitation, and giving more attention to effective communication and information exchange with families. AR-MPOC-20 is recommended for use for program evaluation. Adapted from the source document.},

abstract={Purpose MRI is used to obtain quantitative oxygenation and blood volume information from the susceptibility-related MR signal dephasing induced by blood vessels. However, analytical models that fit the MR signal are usually not accurate over the range of small blood vessels. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated limitations in the simultaneous assessment of oxygenation and blood volume. In this study, a multiparametric MRI framework that aims to measure vessel radii in addition to magnetic susceptibility and volume fraction was introduced. Methods The protocol consisted of gradient-echo sampling of the spin-echo, diffusion, T2, and B0 acquisitions. After correction steps, the data were postprocessed with a versatile numerical model of the MR signal. An important analytical model was implemented for comparison. The approach was validated in phantoms with coiling strings as proxy for blood vessels. Results The feasibility of the vessel radius measurement is demonstrated. The numerical model shows an improved accuracy compared with the analytical approach. However, both methods overestimate the radius. The simultaneous measurement of the magnetic susceptibility and the volume fraction remains challenging. Conclusion The results suggest that this approach could be interesting in vivo to better characterize the microvasculature without contrast agent.

abstract={Magnetic resonance (MR)-based electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a widely used imaging technique that provides high-resolution conductivity images at DC or below the 1kHz frequency range. Using an MR scanner, this technique injects imaging currents into the human body and measures induced internal magnetic flux density data. By applying the recent progress of MREIT techniques, such as chemical shift artifact correction, multi-echo pulse sequence, and improved reconstruction algorithm, we can successfully reconstruct conductivity images of the human body. Meanwhile, numerous studies reported that the electrical conductivity of human tissues could be inferred from in vitro or ex vivo measurements of different species. However, in vivo tissues may differ from in vitro and/or ex vivo state due to the complicated tissue responses in living organs. In this study, we performed in vivo MREIT imaging of a human lower extremity and compared the resulting conductivity images with ex vivo biological tissue phantom images. The human conductivity images showed unique contrast between two different types of bones, muscles, subcutaneous adipose tissues, and conductive body fluids. Except for muscles and adipose tissues, the human conductivity images showed a similar pattern when compared with phantom results due to the anisotropic characteristic of muscle and the high conductive fluids in the adipose tissue.

abstract={Purpose Vessel-encoded (VE) pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (p-CASL) is a territorial ASL (T-ASL) technique to identify the perfusion territories of cerebral arteries. The aim of this study was to validate the output of three Vessel-encoded p-CASL image processing methods, k-means clustering with and without subsequent linear analysis and a Bayesian framework, by comparison with the perfusion maps acquired with super-selective p-CASL. Methods The comparison was done quantitatively using the Hausdorff distance and Dice similarity coefficient in the territories of the right and left internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the right and left vertebral arteries. A qualitative comparison was done in the areas of the anterior and posterior circulation, and the deep gray matter. Results The overall agreement between the Vessel-encoded p-CASL image processing methods and super-selective p-CASL was good; with the difference that the linear analysis and the Bayesian framework were able to detect mixed perfusion. Conclusion Planning-free Vessel-encoded p-CASL with k-means clustering appears suitable as a general purpose T-ASL strategy, but to determine mixed perfusion a combination with linear analysis, or the Bayesian framework is preferable, which are superior in this regard. To accurately determine the perfusion territory of a single vessel, super-selective p-CASL is still recommended. Magn Reson Med 71:2059-2070, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Introduction: MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) has attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians as a potential modality for cancer treatment over the last decades. Despite recent progress, the real application of MRgFUS still remains a challenge due to problems with the optimization of ultrasound parameters and standardization of clinical protocol. In this study, we utilized an ex vivo animal model in order to elucidate the effect of focused acoustic energy on kidney tissue. Material & Methods: The explanted porcine kidney was sonicated under MR-guidance by using a clinical Focused Ultrasound (FUS) system (ExAblate 2000 Body system, InSightec, Haifa, Israel). The study employed MR-based temperature mapping (Proton Resonance Frequency method) for control of the ablation. The data of temperature measurement has been compared to histological analysis of treated tissues. Results: The temperature mapping data demonstrated a rise of temperature at the focal point up to 440C (SD plus or minus 1), which was thought to be sufficient enough to trigger hyperthermia effects. Histopathological analysis showed tissue destruction as a result of massive cavitation in treated tissues. The signs of mechanical damage were more pronounced in a place that was treated 240 seconds compared with the first location (sonicated 120 seconds). Conclusions: The effect of FUS on the tissues of animal kidney was investigated. The achieved level of temperature rise in the focal point was high enough to induce hyperthermia suggesting possible clinical application. Histology of treated tissue indicated that its therapeutic effect was mediated by focused ultrasound. The correlation between duration of sonication and tissue damage was demonstrated.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to examine germ cells apoptosis and reduction of spermatogenesis which might be induced by deltamethrin (DM). Furthermore, the study is performed to determine if the apoptosis is mediated by the signaling proteins: eNOS, JNK1 and androgen receptor (AR). Fifty-four male SD rats were divided into nine groups (six rats each): blank control group; corn oil treated group; DM treated group; saline treated group; DM+saline treated group; DM+histamine (eNOS specific agonist) treated group; 50% ethanol treated group; DM+50% ethanol group and DM+quercetagetin (JNK1 specific inhibitor) treated group. The experiment was conducted for 15 days. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL; S-nitrosylation of JNK1 was examined by the biotin switch assay; eNOS expression and Ser650 phosphorylation of AR were assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. DM treated group showed notable apoptotic cells and reduced production of sperm, while DM plus histamine group and DM plus quercetagetin group showed remarkably decreased apoptosis and improved production of sperm. Administration of DM inhibited spermatogenesis, the activity of eNOS and S-nitrosylation of JNK1. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of AR was shown to be elevated. Histamine and quercetagetin were also examined to have a further confirmation. It is suggested DM-induced germ cells apoptosis and reduction of sperm production were mediated by eNOS-JNK1-AR signaling pathway.},

abstract={Objective: There is a close relation between cartilage health and its hydration state. Current magnetic resonance methods allow visualizing this tissue. However, a quantitative analysis is more useful when studying disease. The purpose of this study was to quantify water content in cartilage using magnetic resonance without contrast agents. Materials and methods: Water-content estimations using T1 magnetic resonance mapping were done first in eight gelatin samples where the water content was previously known. The same method was used in the physeal areas of eight skeletally immature 30-kg pigs. To calculate accuracy, T1 calculations were compared to dry-freeze, which is considered the gold standard because it can remove the total water content form a tissue. Four fresh cartilage and seven gelatin samples were dry-frozen. Water content obtained from dry-freeze was compared to the one calculated from T1 map values. A mathematical model and statistical analysis were used to calculate the predictive value of the method and its significance. Results: T1-map-based magnetic resonance method can calculate water content in cartilage with an accuracy of 97.3 %. We calculated a coefficient of variance for this method against dry-frozen sample of 3.68 (SD=1.2) in gelatin samples, and 2.73 (SD=1.3) in in vivo samples. Between two independent observers, the coefficient of variance was 0.053, which suggests it can be easily reproduced. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance was able to calculate, with high accuracy, the cartilage water content using T1 mapping sequences.},

abstract={We sought to evaluate the accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT cameras for the measurement of left ventricular (LV) global and regional function, and the performance of absolute wall motion (WM) and wall thickness (WT) measurements for the detection of myocardial scarring, using cardiac MR as a reference. Sixty patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease underwent MPI using a CZT SPECT camera, as well as cine and delayed enhanced cardiac MR. Gated MPI data were processed using quantitative gated SPECT software. LV global function was assessed by measuring LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF). Regional function was assessed by quantifying segmental WM and WT according to the 17-segment model. Myocardial scarring was quantified on each segment using delayed enhanced cardiac MR. Agreement between SPECT and cardiac MR was assessed using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analyses. The influence of measurement magnitude on the agreement was analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficients between the mean and SD of measurements. The performance of WM and WT for the detection of segments with more than 25% scar transmurality was assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Correlation between methods was excellent for EF (R = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and ESV (R = 0.88, P < 0.0001) and was good for EDV (R = 0.71, P < 0.0001). Agreement was good for EF (bias, -2.7%; limits of agreement, -15.5 to +10.1) but was lower for EDV (bias, -29.7 mL; limits of agreement, -68.3 to +8.9) and ESV (bias, -9.9 mL; limits of agreement, -30.7 to +10.9). Correlation between methods was fair for WM (R = 0.49, P < 0.0001) and WT (R = 0.48, P < 0.0001). SPECT underestimated WT (bias, -41%; limits of agreement, -108 to +26), with an error depending on thickening magnitude (... = 0.70, P < 0.0001). The agreement in WM measurement was higher (bias, -1.4 mm; limits of agreement, -6.9 to +4) and independent of motion magnitude (... = 0.006, P = 0.86). WM and WT were equally able to identify scarred segments (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.74 ± 0.03 and 0.74 ± 0.03, respectively). MPI using CZT SPECT cameras and quantitative gated SPECT analysis accurately quantifies EF but still underestimates LV volumes. WM shows a higher agreement with cardiac MR than does WT, with errors in WT measurement increasing at greater thicknesses. Absolute quantification of segmental WM and WT can equally be used to identify myocardial scarring. (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae/symbols omitted.)},

abstract={Determination of the Resilient modulusMR for the lime stabilized clay obtained from therepeated loading CBR tests. The main aim of this paper is to prove that CBR repeated test is useful to give an adequate like unconfi ned cyclic triaxial test parameters for design the pavement and subgrade soils. That parameter is the Resilient modulus (MR) which is the elastic modulus based on the recoverable strain under repeated load. Resilient modulus (MR), is an important parameter which characterizes the subgrade’s ability to withstand repetitive stresses under traffic loadings. The 1993 AASHTO guide for design of flexible pavements recommends the use of MR. The additional aim is connected with the concept of sustainable development. For many countries, where resources are at premium, it is very important that stabilized local soil can be used for road construction. For ensuring that stabilized clay can be used for pavement material standard compaction, CBR and repeated CBR tests were performed. In that paper parameter MRof the subgrade lime stabilized clay soil by laboratory CBR repeated test were determined using for calculation formulas from triaxial cyclic test. Based on AASHTO empirical equation the static CBR values using back analysis was also calculated. Finally both values of CBR determined and calculated were compared.},

In order to investigate the advantages of each controller, a three-degrees-of-freedom steel moment-resisting frame, designed using a performance-based design methodology, was developed. The performance has been investigated by using four different earthquakes utilized during the design of the building frame. Comparisons of the controllers' performance have been carried out in terms of reduction in the maximum interstory drifts, displacements, absolute accelerations, and control forces. Real-time hybrid tests have been carried out to validate these comparisons.},

abstract={The article describes results of durability test of a magnetorheological fluid (MRF), which was carried out in rheometer of own design. The rheometer design enables to measure the rheological properties of MR fluid and to expose it to a long-term loading simultaneously, without any manipulation of the measured sample. During the durability test a change of the two most important parameters of Bingham model describing the behavior of MR fluids can be followed - dynamic viscosity and yield stress. In this paper the yield stress and viscosity were evaluated depending on temperature in OFF-state. The results show a significant change of yield strength during durability test depending on temperature of loading. Dependence of yield stress on temperature was proved. The viscosity decreased by 36% from its initial value after the dissipation of 9divide]20kJcm super(-3) from total 1.2 MJcm super(-3) and then has remained the same until the end of durability test. Viscosity was evaluated depending on temperature.},

abstract={A transmission method of magnetorheological (MR) fluid in cylindrical-type driven by shape memory alloy (SMA) spring with the thermal effect was proposed. The torque can change rapidly with temperature. Based on the thermal effect of SMA, the expression for displacement of SMA spring was established. The rheological property of MR fluid under the magnetic fields was described by Bingham model. Based on momentum equation, the shear flow of MR fluid between two cylinders was analyzed and the expressions of flow velocity and torque have been obtained. The experimental results show the output displacement of SMA spring and the transmit torque of MR fluid is directly proportional to the temperature and the applied magnetic field, respectively.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop and validate a method to identify computationally efficient site- and patient-specific models of ultrasound thermal therapies from MR thermal images. The models of the specific absorption rate of the transduced energy and the temperature response of the therapy target are identified in the reduced basis of proper orthogonal decomposition of thermal images, acquired in response to a mild thermal test excitation. The method permits dynamic reidentification of the treatment models during the therapy by recursively utilizing newly acquired images. Such adaptation is particularly important during high-temperature therapies, which are known to substantially and rapidly change tissue properties and blood perfusion. The developed theory was validated for the case of focused ultrasound heating of a tissue phantom. The experimental and computational results indicate that the developed approach produces accurate low-dimensional treatment models despite temporal and spatial noises in MR images and slow image acquisition rate.},

abstract={Substances and methods used to increase oxygen blood transport and physical performance can be detected in the blood, but the screening of the athletes to be tested remains a critical issue for the International Federations. This project, AR.I.E.T.T. A., aimed to develop a software capable of analysing athletes' hematological and performance profiles to detect abnormal patterns. One-hundred eighty athletes belonging to the International Biathlon Union gave written informed consent to have their hematological data, previously collected according to anti-doping rules, used to develop the AR.I.E.T.T.A. software. Software was developed with the included sections: 1) log-in; 2) data-entry: where data are loaded, stored and grouped; 3) analysis: where data are analysed, validated scores are calculated, and parameters are simultaneously displayed as statistics, tables and graphs, and individual or subpopulation profiles; 4) screening: where an immediate evaluation of the risk score of the present sample and/or the athlete under study is obtained. The sample risk score or AR.I.E.T.T.A. score is calculated by a simple computational system combining different parameters (absolute values and intra-individual variations) considered concurrently. The AR.I.E.T.T.A. score is obtained by the sum of the deviation units derived from each parameter, considering the shift of the present value from the reference values, based on the number of standard deviations. AR.I.E.T.T.A. enables a quick evaluation of blood results assisting surveillance programs and perform timely target testing controls on athletes by the International Federations. Future studies aiming to validate the AR.I.E.T.T.A. score and improve the diagnostic accuracy will improve the system.},

abstract={To date there are no validated methods available to test androgenicity or antiandrogenicity in vitro. A problem with testing androgenicity using reporter genes is the possibility by other steroid receptors than androgen receptors to activate the same reporter gene, thereby lowering selectivity. To avoid this we have established a robust and very selective method, the AR CALUXA+ reporter gene assay, to test androgenic and antiandrogenic activity of compounds in vitro. This assay uses a human U2-OS cell line stably transfected with the human androgen receptor and an androgen receptor responsive reporter gene. We optimized protocols to be used in combination with AR CALUX cells and carried out an in house prevalidation. In addition we successfully transferred this assay to another laboratory, leading to comparable test results with a panel of androgen receptor agonists and antagonists. The assay was able to readily rank a range of chemicals on the basis of their EC50 values. The CALUX assay was found to be selective for androgens and seemed not influenced by signaling through other steroid receptors.},

abstract={PURPOSE: To determine the test characteristics of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in the assessment of occlusion of aneurysms treated with coil placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an ethics committee-approved multicenter study. written informed consent was obtained in 311 patients with 343 aneurysms, who had been treated with coil placement and were scheduled for routine follow-up with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Thirty-five patients participated two or three times. Either 3.0- or 1.5-T time-of-flight (TOF) and contrast material-enhanced MR angiography were performed in addition to intraarterial DSA. Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated by independent readers at DSA and MR angiography. The test characteristics of MR angiography were assessed by using DSA as the standard. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for 3.0- versus 1.5-T MR angiography and for TOF versus contrast-enhanced MR angiography, and factors associated with discrepancies between MR angiography and DSA were assessed with logistic regression. RESULTS: Aneurysm assessments (n = 381) at DSA and MR angiography were compared. Incomplete occlusion was seen at DSA in 88 aneurysms (23%). Negative predictive value of MR angiography was 94% (95% confidence interval CI]: 91%, 97%), positive predictive value was 69% (95% CI: 60%, 78%), sensitivity was 82% (95% CI: 72%, 89%), and specificity was 89% (95% CI: 85%, 93%). AUCs were similar for 3.0- (0.90 95% CI: 0.86, 0.94]) and 1.5-T MR (0.87 95% CI: 0.78, 0.95]) and for TOF MR (0.86 95% CI: 0.81, 0.91]) versus contrast-enhanced MR (0.85 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91]). A small residual lumen (odds ratio, 2.1 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3]) and suboptimal projection at DSA (odds ratio, 5.5 95% CI: 1.5, 21.0]) were independently associated with discordance between intraarterial DSA and MR angiography. CONCLUSION: Documentation of good diagnostic performance of TOF MR angiography at both 1.5 and 3.0 T in the current study represents an important step toward replacing intraarterial DSA with MR angiography in the follow-up of patients with aneurysms treated with coils. copy ] RSNA, 2010 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10091528 / -/DC1},

abstract={Most morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with appropriate sample sizes reveal a decreased right caudate nucleus volume. Recently, our group reported that this decrease is mainly due to a diminished right caudate body volume (rCBV). Here, we hypothesize that, employing either the total bilateral caudate volume (tbCV) or the bilateral caudate body volume (bCBV) as scaling variables, the rCBV/tbCV and rCBV/bCBV ratios could be found diminished and used as a basis of an imaging diagnostic test. Volumetric caudate nucleus data were obtained from a case-control morphometric MRI study with 39 ADHD subjects and 39 handedness- and IQ-matched controls, using a novel semi-automated caudate segmentation procedure. Student t-tests comparing each relevant ratio were conducted between the two samples. After splitting the samples into two groups, a receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted on the training group to determine the optimal cut-off. Its performance was then examined on the test group. The rCBV/bCBV ratio was found to be statistically different. For a value equal or inferior to 0.48, the specificity was 95.00%. We propose using the rCBV/bCBV ratio to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD in children.},

abstract={An MR-compatible ergometer was developed for in-magnet whole-body human exercise testing. Designed on the basis of conventional mechanically braked bicycle ergometers and constructed from nonferrous materials, the ergometer was implemented on a 1.5-T whole-body MR scanner. A spectrometer interface was constructed using standard scanner hardware, complemented with custom-built parts and software to enable gated data acquisition during exercise. High-quality 31P NMR spectra were reproducibly obtained from the medial head of the quadriceps muscle of the right leg of eight healthy subjects during two-legged high-frequency pedaling (80 revolutions per minute) at three incremental workloads, including maximal. Muscle phosphocreatine content dropped 82%, from 32.2 +/- 1.0 mM at rest to 5.7 +/- 1.1 mM at maximal workload (mean +/- standard error; n = 8), indicating that the majority of quadriceps motor units were recruited. The cardiovascular load of the exercise was likewise significant, as evidenced by heart rates of 150 (+/-10%) beats per minute, measured immediately afterward. As such, the newly developed MR bicycling exercise equipment offers a powerful new tool for clinical musculoskeletal and cardiovascular MR investigation. The basic design of the ergometer is highly generic and adaptable for application on a wide selection of whole-body MR scanners. Magn Reson Med, 2010. copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={This paper experimentally investigates the feasibility of an adaptive passive control system, which consists of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper and an electromagnetic induction (EMI) part, for suppressing vibration of building structures subjected to ground accelerations. In the adaptive passive control system, the EMI part composed of a permanent magnet and a coil convert the kinetic energy of the relative motion between a building and a damper into the electric energy, which is used for a change in damping characteristics of the MR fluid damper. Since the EMI part can be used as a controller, which determines the command voltage input according to structural responses as well as a power source, the adaptive passive system can be much more compact, convenient, and economic than a conventional active/semiactive system that needs a power supply, a controller, and sensors. To experimentally verify the feasibility of the adaptive passive control system, a shaking table test of a small-scale building model employing the MR fluid damper with the EMI part is conducted. The performance of the adaptive passive control system is compared with that of passively operated MR fluid damper-based semiactive control systems.},

abstract={Introduction: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of adding combined super(18)F-PET/CT to MRI for T and N staging of the oral and oropharyngeal cancer and calculation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) having histopathology as reference standard. Methods: PET/CT and MRI were performed in 66 patients with suspected oral and oropharyngeal cancer (41 primary tumors/25 recurrent tumors) and nodal disease (114 nodes). Statistical analysis included the McNemar test, sensitivity, specificity for the diagnostic modalities as well as regression analysis, and Bland-Altman graphs for calculated tumor volumes. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the two modalities compared to pathological findings regarding detection of disease (P.0.72). The sensitivity/specificity for tumor detection were 100/80% and 96.72/60% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. The sensitivity/specificity for nodal metastases were 88.46/75% and 83.81/73.91% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. In 18% of cases, the MRI-based T staging resulted in an overestimation of the pathologic tumor stage. The corresponding rate for PET/CT was 22%. Regarding the treated necks, both modalities showed 100% sensitivity for detection of the recurrent lesions. In necks with histologically N0 staging, MRI and PET/CT gave 22% and 26% false positive findings, respectively. The mean tumor volume in the pathologic specimen was 16.6c18.6ml, the mean volume derived by the MR imaging was 17.6c19.1ml while the estimated by PET/CT volume was 18.8c18.1ml (P,0.007 between the three methods). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a better agreement between PET/CT and MRI. Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in the local staging of oral cancer is not superior to MRI.},

abstract={Myocardial elastography (ME), a radio-frequency (RF) based speckle tracking technique, was employed in order to image the entire two-dimensional (2D) transmural deformation field in full echocardiographic views and was validated against tagged magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) in normal as well as reperfused (i.e., treated myocardial infarction MI]) human left ventricles. RF ultrasound and tMRI frames were acquired at the papillary muscle level in 2D short-axis (SA) views at the frame rates of 136 (fps; real-time) and 33 fps (electrocardiogram ECG]-gated), respectively. In ME, in-plane, 2D (lateral and axial) incremental displacements were iteratively estimated using one-dimensional (1D) cross-correlation and recorrelation techniques in a 2D search with a 1D matching kernel. In tMRI, cardiac motion was estimated by a template-matching algorithm on a 2D grid-shaped mesh. In both ME and tMRI, cumulative 2D displacements were obtained and then used to estimate 2D Lagrangian finite systolic strains, from which polar (i.e., radial and circumferential) strains, namely angle-independent measures, were further obtained through coordinate transformation. Principal strains, which are angle-independent and less centroid-dependent than polar strains, were also computed and imaged based on the 2D finite strains using methodology previously established. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, angle- independent ME is shown to be capable of (1) estimating myocardial deformation in good agreement with tMRI estimates in a clinical setting and of (2) differentiating abnormal from normal myocardium in a full left- ventricular view. The principal strains were concluded to be a potential diagnostic measure for detection of cardiac disease with reduced centroid dependence.},

abstract={PURPOSE: To prospectively determine the sensitivity and specificity of functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for mapping language and motor functions in patients with a focal mass adjacent to eloquent cortex, by using intraoperative electrocortical mapping (ECM) as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethics committee approved the study, and patients gave written informed consent. Thirty-four consecutive patients (16 women, 18 men; mean age, 43.2 years) were included who met the following three criteria: They had a focal mass in or adjacent to eloquent cortex of the language or motor system, they had the ability to perform the functional MR imaging task, and they had to undergo surgery with intraoperative ECM. Functional MR imaging with verb generation (n = 17) or finger tapping of the contralateral hand (n = 17) was performed at 1.5 T with a block design and an echo-planar gradient-echo T2*-weighted sequence. Cortex essential for language or hand motor functions was mapped with ECM. A site-by-site comparison between functional MR imaging and ECM was performed with the aid of a neuronavigational device. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to task performed, histopathologic findings, and tumor grade. Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each sensitivity and specificity value. RESULTS: For 34 consecutive patients, there were 28 with gliomas, two with metastases, one with meningioma, and three with cavernous angiomas. A total of 251 cortical sites were tested with ECM; overall functional MR imaging sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 82%, respectively. Sensitivity (65%) was lower and specificity (93%) was higher in World Health Organization grade IV gliomas compared with grade II (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 79%) and III (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 76%) gliomas. At 3 months after surgery, language proficiency was unchanged in 15 patients; functionality of the contralateral arm was unchanged in 14 patients and improved in one patient. CONCLUSION: Functional MR imaging is a sensitive and specific method for mapping language and motor functions. copy ] RSNA, 2008},

abstract={BACKGROUND: and Purpose- Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMR) is increasingly used in acute stroke, but its physiologic significance is still debated. A reasonably good correlation between pMR and positron emission tomography (PET) has been reported in normal subjects and chronic cerebrovascular disease, but corresponding validation in acute stroke is still lacking. METHODS: We compared the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time (MTT) maps generated by pMR (deconvolution method) and PET ( super(15)O steady-state method) in 5 patients studied back-to-back with the 2 modalities at a mean of 16 hours (range, 7 to 21 hours) after stroke onset. We also determined the penumbra thresholds for pMR-derived MTT, time to peak (TTP), and Tmax against the previously validated probabilistic PET penumbra thresholds. RESULTS: In all patients, the PET and pMR relative distribution images were remarkably similar, especially for CBF and MTT. Within-patient correlations between pMR and PET were strong for absolute CBF (average r super(2)=0.45) and good for MTT (r super(2)=0.35) but less robust for cerebral blood volume (r super(2)=0.24). However, pMR overestimated absolute CBF and underestimated MTT, with substantial variability in individual slopes. Removing individual differences by normalization to the mean resulted in much stronger between-patient correlations. Penumbra thresholds of approximately 6, 4.8, and 5.5 seconds were obtained for MTT delay, TTP delay, and Tmax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although derived from a small sample studied relatively late after stroke onset, our data show that pMR tends to overestimate absolute CBF and underestimate MTT, but the relative distribution of the perfusion variables was remarkably similar between pMR and PET. pMR appears sufficiently reliable for clinical purposes and affords reliable detection of the penumbra from normalized time-based thresholds.},

abstract={The most widely used configuration of MR dampers incorporates an annular gap through which the magnetically active MR fluid is forced to flow. The damping force, which is also known as the restoring force and opposes the applied external force, is produced by the movement of the MR fluid through this annular gap. The design of this annular gap usually utilises an approximation that represents this assembly as a flow of fluids between two infinitely wide parallel plates. This assumption has been found to be fairly accurate and sufficient for engineering design purposes, especially when the size of the annular gap is small relative to the mean radius of the annulus, which is usually the case for MR dampers. However, it is still important to have expressions that represent the physical processes exactly. In this paper, the general solutions are derived and the corresponding methodology for representing exactly the flow of fluids with a yield stress through annuli is given. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were also carried out to validate the general expressions presented. The general expression is applicable to any models of fluids with a yield stress. An example of the application of the general analytical expressions using the Herschel-Buckley model is given, and the limitations of the parallel-plate approximation is illustrated for configurations whereby the size of the annular gap relative to the mean radius is large. A mathematical model for a double-tube MR damper fabricated at the University of Manchester, UK is developed based on the annular solution and on the compressibility of MR fluid inside the chambers. It is shown that the modelling procedure represents the MR damper satisfactorily.},

abstract={The progression of neurodegenerative diseases as well as healthy aging is accompanied by structural changes of the brain. These changes are often only subtle when considered over time intervals of several months. Therefore morphometrical techniques for their detection in longitudinally acquired MR images must be highly sensitive, and they require a careful validation. In the present study, a novel processing chain for a longitudinal analysis based on deformation field morphometry is described. Procedures for its quantitative validation are also reported: Deformation fields were computed for the simulation of non-linear, local structural changes of human brains. Applying these deformation fields to "original" MR images yielded deformed MR images. The volume changes defined by the deformation fields represented the standard, against which the results of the longitudinal analysis of each pair of original and deformed MR image were compared. The proposed processing chain enabled to localize and to quantify simulated local atrophies near the cortex as well as in deep brain structures. An exemplary analysis of serial MR images of a patient suffering from an atypical Parkinson syndrome (cortico-basal degeneration, CBD) and healthy control subjects is presented, showing a characteristic pattern of volume changes in the brain of the patient which is strikingly different from the controls' patterns of changes.},

abstract={Many magnetic resonance test-object properties are temperature-dependent, with typical temperature coefficients of 2-3% K-1. Therefore, to achieve consistent quality assurance measurements to within 1%, test object temperatures should ideally be known to within 0.3K. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has previously been used to estimate accurately absolute tissue temperature in vivo, based on the linear temperature dependence of the chemical shift difference between water and temperature-stable reference metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate. In this study, this method of internal thermometry in quality assurance test-objects was investigated, and in particular the value of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propane-1-sulfonate (DSS) as a chemical shift reference was demonstrated. The relationship between the DSS-water chemical shift difference (, expressed in ppm) and temperature (in K) was shown to be =764.55 (-5.05)-97.72 (-1.05) (286309K). Internal thermometry in MRI test-objects is feasible and straightforward, using readily available 1H-MRS pulse sequences and standard spectroscopy evaluation packages, with a minimum detectable temperature difference of 100 (-20)mK.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: Imaging of the anterior superficial spinal cord arteries by MR angiography is hindered by their small calibers and the similarity in configuration with the anterior superficial spinal cord veins. To validate the location and spatial configuration of the great anterior radiculomedullary artery, (ie, the Adamkiewicz artery AKA]), contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) was compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS: Fifteen patients with suspected spinal cord vascular pathology underwent both spinal CE-MRA and selective spinal DSA. Two phase CE-MRA was performed with the use of a centric k-space filling scheme synchronized to the contrast bolus arrival. The level and side of the AKA origin were scored on the DSA and CE-MRA images and compared regarding image quality in terms of vessel conspicuity, contrast, continuity, sharpness, and background homogeneity on a relative 5-point scale. RESULTS: Localization and spatial configuration of the AKA by CE-MRA was in agreement with DSA findings in 14 of 15 cases. One mismatch of 1 vertebral level (not side) appeared as a result of the tangled vascular pathology. Comparison of image quality revealed that DSA is superior to CE-MRA concerning vessel continuity, sharpness, and background homogeneity (P < .001). Overall vessel conspicuity and contrast were judged to be similar. CONCLUSION: CE-MRA can visualize and localize the level of the AKA correctly. Image quality of CE-MRA is sufficient for detection of the AKA but is inferior to DSA.},

abstract={As population-based epidemiologic studies may acquire images from thousands of subjects, automated image post-processing is needed. However, error in these methods may be biased and related to subject characteristics relevant to the research question. Here, we compare two automated methods of brain extraction against manually segmented images and evaluate whether method accuracy is associated with subject demographic and health characteristics. MRI data (n = 296) are from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, a population-based study of elderly Japanese-American men. The intracranial space was manually outlined on the axial proton density sequence by a single operator. The brain was extracted automatically using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) and BSE (Brain Surface Extractor) on axial proton density images. Total intracranial volume was calculated for the manually segmented images (ticvM), the BET segmented images (ticvBET) and the BSE segmented images (ticvBSE). Mean ticvBSE was closer to that of ticvM, but ticvBET was more highly correlated with ticvM than ticvBSE. BSE had significant over (positive error) and underestimated (negative error) ticv, but net error was relatively low. BET had large positive and very low negative error. Method accuracy, measured in percent positive and negative error, varied slightly with age, head circumference, presence of the apolipoprotein e epsilon 4 polymorphism, subcortical and cortical infracts and enlarged ventricles. This epidemiologic approach to the assessment of potential bias in image post-processing tasks shows both skull-stripping programs performed well in this large image dataset when compared to manually segmented images. Although method accuracy was statistically associated with some subject characteristics, the extent of the misclassification (in terms of percent of brain volume) was small.},

abstract={NAVDAS-AR is the 4DVAR extension of the United States Navy's operational 3DVAR data assimilation system, NAVDAS (Naval Research Laboratory Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System), where AR stands for accelerated representer. Like NAVDAS, NAVDAS-AR is cast in observation space, and is an observation space formulation of the 4DVAR algorithm, in contrast to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 4DVAR system, which is an analysis space algorithm. In this paper we show how an inner loop linear solution can be augmented by an outer loop iteration procedure that introduces non-linear effects in the form of a first-order Taylor series expansion. The non-linear problem is then solved iteratively as a sequence of linear problems. We show results of the outer loop strategy, where the first loop, the 'linear' solution, is modified in the second outer loop by both a Taylor series term in the calculation of the observation innovations, and a linearized form of the background model that is linearized about an analysis 'trajectory' from the solution of the first loop. We also show results of how the outer loop strategy allows better assimilation of observations of surface wind speed and precipitable water, compared to the operational NAVDAS.},

abstract={To evaluate the feasibility of MR colonography (MRC) with air using two-dimensional (2D) T1-weighted fast spin-echo (T1wFSE) in patients scheduled for conventional colonoscopy (CC) after classic bowel preparation, and assess the ability of the technique to detect colonic lesions. The distention was sufficient for diagnosis, and the technique provided adequate delineation of the wall in the majority of segments. Residual fluid obscured the wall in different segments, especially in the ascending and descending colon (supine position) and in the cecum, transverse, and sigmoid colon (prone position). These findings were consistent with CT colonography. MRC visualized three lesions, missed one lesion >10 mm, visualized none of four lesions <5 mm, and yielded one false-positive lesion (5-10 mm). Missed lesions can be due to inconsistency in the slice positions between consecutive breath-holds, which is inherent to the multishot technique. Residual fluid may have obscured the smaller lesions. The shortcomings of the technique are limited coverage and signal drop-off at the borders of the field of view (FOV). Before multishot 2D T1wFSE colonography can become a valid screening method, improved patient preparation and a more practical technique are needed.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: The choice of arterial input function (AIF) can have a profound effect on the blood flow maps generated on perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI). Automation of this process could substantially reduce operator dependency, increase consistency, and accelerate PWI analysis. We created an automated AIF identification program (auto-AIF) and validated its performance against conventional manual methods. METHODS: We compared the auto-AIF against manually derived AIFs from multisection PWIs of 22 patients with stroke. Time to peak, curve width, curve height, and voxel location determined with both techniques were compared. The time to maximum of the tissue residue function (Tmax) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were computed on a per-pixel basis for each AIF. Spatial patterns of 528 map pairs were compared by computing Pearson correlation coefficients between maps generated with each method. RESULTS: All auto-AIF-derived PWI map parameters, including bolus peak, width, and height, were consistently superior to manually derived ones. Reproducibility of the auto-AIF-based Tmax maps was excellent (r = 1.0). Paired Tmax maps and CBF maps from both techniques were well correlated (r = 0.82). Time to identify the AIF was significantly shorter with the auto-AIF method than with the manual technique (mean difference, 72 seconds; 95% confidence interval: 54, 89 seconds). CONCLUSION: An automated program that identifies the AIF is feasible and can create reliably reproducible and accurate Tmax and CBF maps. Automation of this process could reduce PWI analysis time and increase consistency and may allow for more effective use of PWI in the evaluation of acute stroke.},

abstract={Purpose Brain tumor radiotherapy requires the volume measurements and the localization of several individual brain structures. Any tool that can assist the physician to perform the delineation would then be of great help. Among segmentation methods, those that are atlas-based are appealing because they are able to segment several structures simultaneously, while preserving the anatomy topology. This study aims to evaluate such a method in a clinical context. Methods and materials The brain atlas is made of two three-dimensional (3D) volumes: the first is an artificial 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the second consists of the segmented structures in this artificial MRI. The elastic registration of the artificial 3D MRI against a patient 3D MRI dataset yields an elastic transformation that can be applied to the labeled image. The elastic transformation is obtained by minimizing the sum of the square differences of the image intensities and derived from the optical flow principle. This automatic delineation (AD) enables the mapping of the segmented structures onto the patient MRI. Parameters of the AD have been optimized on a set of 20 patients. Results are obtained on a series of 6 patients' MRI. A comprehensive validation of the AD has been conducted on performance of atlas-based segmentation in a clinical context with volume, position, sensitivity, and specificity that are compared by a panel of seven experimented physicians for the brain tumor treatments. Results Expert interobserver volume variability ranged from 16.70 cm3 to 41.26 cm3. For patients, the ratio of minimal to maximal volume ranged from 48% to 70%. Median volume varied from 19.47 cm3 to 27.66 cm3 and volume of the brainstem calculated by AD varied from 17.75 cm3 to 24.54 cm3. Medians of experts ranged, respectively, for sensitivity and specificity, from 0.75 to 0.98 and from 0.85 to 0.99. Median of AD were, respectively, 0.77 and 0.97. Mean of experts ranged, respectively, from 0.78 to 0.97 and from 0.86 to 0.99. Mean of AD were, respectively, 0.76 and 0.97. Conclusions Results demonstrate that the method is repeatable, provides a good trade-off between accuracy and robustness, and leads to reproducible segmentation and labeling. These results can be improved by enriching the atlas with the rough information of tumor or by using different laws of deformation for the different structures. Qualitative results also suggest that this method can be used for automatic segmentation of other organs such as neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and limbs.},

abstract={As a model for guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency in humans, a gene knockout mouse model was generated. Here we report on several metabolic abnormalities in these mice, observed by in vivo and in vitro MR spectroscopy. In super(1)H MR spectra of brain and hindleg muscle a clearly reduced signal of creatine (Cr) was observed in GAMT-deficient (GAMT-/-) animals. Analysis of the super(1)H MR spectra of GAMT-/- brain indicated little or no increase of a signal for guanidinoacetate (Gua). In proton MR spectra of muscle, a broad signal of low intensity was observed for Gua. However, substantial Gua accumulation in intact muscle tissue was unequivocally confirmed in high- resolution magic angle spinning spectra, in which the Gua signal was resolved as one clear sharp singlet. In super(31)P MR analysis of brain and hindleg muscle a strongly reduced phosphocreatine (PCr) content was shown. In addition, a signal of phosphorylated Gua at 0.5 ppm upfield of PCr was observed, with much higher intensity in muscle than in brain. This signal decreased when ischemia was applied to the muscle and recovered after ischemia was released. Overall, the in vivo super(31)P and super(1)H MR spectroscopy of GAMT-/- mice is similar to that of human GAMT deficiency. This opens up new avenues for the fundamental study of tissue-type dependence of creatine synthesis and transport and for diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of creatine deficiencies in humans.},

In the context of two-dimensional (2D) random field modeling, one of the authors recently proposed a 2D AR quarter-plane model representation using 2D reflection coefficients estimated by a fast recursive adaptive algorithm. Based on such 2D reflection coefficients, we can therefore derive two necessary stability conditions for a 2D AR quarter-plane model. One of these conditions can be considered as an extension of the Schur-Cohn stability criterion based on the 2D reflection coefficients.},

abstract={Rationale and Objectives Catheter-directed intraarterial (IA) injections of gadolinium contrast agents may be used during endovascular interventions with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Injection protocols require further validation. Using a flow phantom and swine, the authors aimed to (a) measure the optimal arterial gadolinium concentration (Gd]) required for MR angiography and (b) validate a proposed IA injection protocol for gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. Materials and Methods For in vitro experiments, the authors placed a catheter in the aorta of an aorto-renal-iliac flow phantom. Injected Gd], injection rates, and aortic blood flow rates were varied independently for 36 separate IA gadolinium injections. The authors performed 2D and 3D MR angiography with a fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence. For subsequent in vivo experiments, they selectively placed catheters within the aorta, renal artery, or common iliac artery of three pigs. Injection rate and injected Gd] were varied. The authors performed 32 separate IA gadolinium injections for 2D MR angiography. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were compared for the various combinations of injection rate and injected Gd]. Results In vitro, an arterial Gd] of 2%-4% produced an optimal SNR for 2D MR angiography, and 3%-5% was best for 3D MR angiography. In swine, an arterial Gd] of 1%-4% produced an optimal SNR. In the phantom and swine experiments, SNR was maintained at higher injection rates by inversely varying the injected Gd]. Conclusion Dilute arterial Gd] is required for optimal IA gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. To maintain an optimal SNR, injection rates and injected Gd] should be varied inversely. The postulated injection protocol was validated.},

abstract={Rationale and Objectives The authors tested whether noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) oximetry is accurate in the in vivo measurement of oxygen saturation in a stroma-free, hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC). Materials and Methods A central venous catheter was placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) of 10 New Zealand white rabbits (weight range, 2.5-3.2 kg). Each rabbit underwent removal of 20% of blood volume followed by resuscitation with 10 mL/kg of bovine HBOC-200. Oxygen saturation of the blood mixture was measured in vivo at the IVC with MR oximetry, with separate in vitro calibration for each animal. Blood drawn from the IVC was measured with ex vivo oximetry, which was used as the standard of reference. The in vivo and ex vivo measurements were compared. Results There was no significant difference (P > .1) between measurements obtained with MR oximetry and ex vivo oximetry. The results with in vivo MR oximetry demonstrated excellent correlation with those from ex vivo oximetry (r = 0.99) over a wide range of physiologic oxygen saturation values (16.7%-74.9%) in venous blood. Conclusion Noninvasive in vivo MR measurement of oxygen saturation is valid for whole blood mixed with stroma-free hemoglobin. Therefore, MR oximetry may be clinically useful for assessing the oxygenation status in patients resuscitated with a HBOC.},

A cylindrical container filled with polymer gel was placed in a water-filled torso phantom to verify a treatment plan for the conformal irradiation of a mediastinal tumor located near the esophagus. Magnetic resonance spin-spin relaxation rate images were acquired and, after calibration, converted to absorbed dose distributions. The dose maps were compared with dose distributions measured using radiographic film. The average root-mean-square structural deviation, for the complete dose distribution, amounted to less than 3% between gel and film dose maps. It may be expected that MR gel dosimetry will become a valuable tool in the verification of 3D dose distributions. The influence of imaging artifacts arising from eddy currents, temperature drift during scanning, and B1 field inhomogeneity on the dose maps was taken into account and minimized.},
