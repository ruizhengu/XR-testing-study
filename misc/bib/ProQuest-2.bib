abstract={This work explored how immersive technologies like virtual reality can be exploited for improved motor learning. While virtual reality is becoming a practical replacement for training that is otherwise expensive, dangerous, or inconvenient to deliver, virtual simulations can also enhance the learning process. Based on the concept of ‘attention computing’, we developed and tested a novel ‘gaze-adaptive’ training method within a virtual putting environment augmented with eye and motion tracking. To our knowledge, this work is the first application of attention computing and adaptive virtual reality to sports skill training. Novice golfers were randomly assigned to either standard putting practice in virtual reality (control) or gaze-adaptive training conditions. For gaze-adaptive training, the golf ball was sensitive to the participant’s gaze and illuminated when fixated upon, to prompt longer and more stable pre-shot fixations. We recorded the effect of these training conditions on task performance, gaze control, and putting kinematics. Gaze-adaptive training was successful in generating more expert-like gaze control and putting kinematics, although this did not transfer to improved performance outcomes within the abbreviated training paradigm. These findings suggest that gaze-adaptive environments can enhance visuomotor learning and may be a promising method for augmenting virtual training environments.},

abstract={Standard automated perimetery is considered the gold standard for evaluating a patient’s visual field. However, it is costly and requires a fixed testing environment. In response, perimetric devices using virtual reality (VR) headsets have emerged as an alternative way to measure visual fields in patients. This systematic review aims to characterize both novel and established VR headsets in the literature and explore their potential applications within visual field testing. A search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Core Collection (Web of Science) for articles published until January 2023. Subject headings and keywords related to virtual reality and visual field were used to identify studies specific to this topic. Records were first screened by title/abstract and then by full text using predefined criteria. Data was extracted accordingly. A total of 2404 records were identified from the databases. After deduplication and the two levels of screening, 64 studies describing 36 VR headset perimetry devices were selected for extraction. These devices encompassed various visual field measurement techniques, including static and kinetic perimetry, with some offering vision rehabilitation capabilities. This review reveals a growing consensus that VR headset perimetry devices perform comparably to, or even better than, standard automated perimetry. They are better tolerated by patients in terms of gaze fixation, more cost-effective, and generally more accessible for patients with limited mobility.Alternate abstract:摘要标准自动视野仪被视作评估患者视野的金标准。然而, 它价格昂贵并且需要固定的测试环境。因此, 使用虚拟现实(VR)耳机的视野仪器成为测量患者视野的替代方法。本综述旨在描述文献中新颖的和成熟的的VR耳机, 并探索它们在视野测试中的潜在应用。使用MEDLINE、Embase、CINAHL和Core Collection(Web of Science)等数据库对2023年1月之前发表的文章进行检索。使用与虚拟现实和视野相关的主题标题和关键词来确定与该主题相关的研究。记录首先通过标题/摘要进行筛选, 然后使用预定义的标准进行全文筛选。提取相应数据。从数据库中共识别出2404条记录。经过删除重复数据和两级筛选后, 选择64项研究36个VR耳机视野测量装置进行提取。这些设备包括各种视野测量技术, 包括静态和动态视野测量, 其中有些提供视力康复功能。本综述揭示了一个日益增长的共识, 即VR耳机视野检查装置的性能与标准自动视野检查相当, 甚至更好。在固视方面它们更容易被患者耐受, 更具成本效益, 并且对行动受限的患者可行性更高。},

abstract={Test anxiety is an emotional state characterized by subjective feelings of discomfort, fear, and worry that can considerably affect students’ academic performance. Virtual Reality exposure (VRE) is a promising approach to address test anxiety, but the few VRE systems for test anxiety in the literature concern only written exams. Since oral exams elicit more anxiety than written exams, the availability of VRE systems for oral exams would be precious to a large population of students worldwide. Another limitation of existing VRE systems for test anxiety is that they require the availability of a head-mounted display, posing a barrier to widespread use. This paper aims to address both issues, proposing a VRE system that deals with oral exams and can be used with common PC displays. The design of the proposed system is organized in three oral test scenarios in which a virtual agent acts as the student’s examiner. The virtual examiner behaves friendly in the first scenario and increasingly reduces its friendliness in the two subsequent scenarios. The paper assesses the feasibility for VRE of the proposed system with two complementary methods. First, we describe a quantitative user study of the three system scenarios, showing that they induce increasing levels of anxiety. Second, we present a qualitative thematic analysis of participants’ post-exposure interviews that sheds further light on the aspects of the virtual experience that contributed to eliciting negative or positive affect in participants, and provides insights for improving VRE systems for test anxiety.},

abstract={Compared to traditional continuous performance tasks, virtual reality-based continuous performance tests (VR-CPT) offer higher ecological validity. While previous studies have primarily focused on behavioral outcomes in VR-CPT and incorporated various distractors to enhance ecological realism, little attention has been paid to the effects of distractors on EEG. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the influence of distractors on EEG during VR-CPT. We studied visual distractors and auditory distractors separately, recruiting 68 subjects (M =20.82, SD =1.72) and asking each to complete four tasks. These tasks were categorized into four groups according to the presence or absence of visual and auditory distractors. We conducted paired t-tests on the mean relative power of the five electrodes in the ROI region across different frequency bands. Significant differences were found in theta waves between Group 3 (M =2.49, SD =2.02) and Group 4 (M =2.68, SD =2.39) (p < 0.05); in alpha waves between Group 3 (M =2.08, SD =3.73) and Group 4 (M =3.03, SD =4.60) (p < 0.001); and in beta waves between Group 1 (M Formula Omitted], SD =2.29) and Group 2 (M Formula Omitted], SD =2.48) (p < 0.001), as well as between Group 3 (M Formula Omitted], SD =2.03) and Group 4 (M Formula Omitted], SD =2.23) (p},

abstract={PurposeTo compare clinical visual field outputs in glaucoma and healthy patients returned by the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) and virtual reality (Virtual Field, VF) perimetry.MethodsOne eye of 54 glaucoma patients and 41 healthy subjects was prospectively tested (three times each in random order) using the HFA and VF perimeters (24‐2 test grids). We extracted and compared global indices (mean deviation MD] and pattern standard deviation PSD]), pointwise sensitivity (and calculated ‘equivalent’ sensitivity after accounting for differences in background luminance) and pointwise defects. Bland–Altman (mean difference Mdiff] and 95% limits of agreement LoA]) and intraclass correlation analyses were performed.ResultsThe VF test was shorter (by 76 s) and had lower fixation losses (by 0.08) and false‐positive rate (by 0.01) compared to the HFA (all p < 0.0001). Intraclass correlations were 0.86, 0.82 and 0.47 for MD, PSD and pointwise sensitivity between devices, respectively. Test–retest variability was higher for VF (Mdiff 0.3 dB, LoA −7.6 to 8.2 dB) compared to the HFA (Mdiff −0.3 dB, LoA −6.4 to 5.9 dB), indicating greater test–retest variability. When using each device's underlying normative database, the HFA detected, on average, 7 more defects (at the p < 0.05 level) out of the 52 test locations compared to this iteration of VF in the glaucoma cohort.ConclusionsVirtual Field returns global results that are correlated with the HFA, but pointwise sensitivities were more variable. Differences in test–retest variability and defect detection by its current normative database raise questions about the widespread adoption of VF in lieu of the HFA.},

abstract={ObjectivesThe Trier social stress test (TSST) is one of the most reliable and widely used laboratory tests for evaluating the physiological stress response. We developed a virtual reality-based TSST (VR-TSST) and investigated the physiological responses to this test in patients with psychosis and healthy controls (HCs).MethodsThe participants comprised 60 patients with psychosis and 66 HCs. The VR-TSST consisted of three scenarios: a resting phase (baseline; 2 min), a job interview (5 min), and a mental arithmetic task (5 min). Blood cortisol levels were measured at baseline, during the test, and at 5–10 min and 30 min after the test. The skin conductance level, heart rate, and RR intervals were measured at baseline, during the job interview, and during the arithmetic task.ResultsThe VR-TSST produced no discernible cortisol response in patients with psychosis compared to the HCs. However, a higher skin conductance level and heart rate and shorter RR intervals were found in the patients than in the HCs at baseline, during the job interview, and during the arithmetic task.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the current version of the VR-TSST induces stronger autonomic and cardiovascular, but not endocrine, responses in patients with psychosis than in HCs. The VR-TSST could be a valuable tool to evaluate or train the stress response in patients with psychosis.},

abstract={BackgroundNew digital technologies (augmented reality headsets, eye-tracking) may potentially allow for automated assessments of ocular misalignment. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of a novel, open-source strabismus test (“STARE”) as an automated screening tool.MethodsWork progressed in 2 phases. In phase 1 (“development”), we used Fresnel prisms to elicit horizontal misalignments of known magnitude (1–40 prism dioptres) in orthotropic controls. In phase 2 (“validation”), we applied the system to adults with an established diagnosis of strabismus, and quantified the ability of the test to distinguish between those with horizontal misalignment and those without. Agreement between the alternate prism cover test measurements and STARE measurements was computed using Bland–Altman plots and product-moment correlation coefficients.ResultsSeven orthotropic controls and nineteen patients with strabismus were recruited (mean age 58.7 ± 22.4 years). STARE was able to identify the presence of horizontal strabismus with an area under the curve of 1.00 (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). The mean difference (bias) {95% CI} was 2.1 {−1.8, 9.9} prism dioptres, and the 95% coefficient of repeatability {95% CI} was ±27.9 {14.8, 50.8} prism dioptres. The Pearson correlation between APCT and STARE was r24 = 0.62, P < 0.001.ConclusionsSTARE shows promise as a simple, automated tool for performing a screening assessment of strabismus. It is a rapid (60 s) test that can be performed using a consumer augmented reality headset with integrated eye-tracking, and might conceivably be used remotely by non-specialists in future as a means of highlighting individuals needing face-to-face specialist care.},

abstract={Despite the rapid growth and popularization of virtual reality (VR) applications, which have enabled new concepts for handling and solving existing problems through VR in various domains, practices related to software engineering have not kept up with this growth. Recent studies indicate that one of the topics that is still little explored in this area is software testing, as VR applications can be built for practically any type of purpose, making it difficult to generalize knowledge to be applied. In this paper, we present an approach that combines metamorphic testing, agent‐based testing and machine learning to test VR applications, focusing on finding collision and camera‐related faults. Our approach proposes the use of metamorphic relations to detect faults in collision and camera components in VR applications, as well as the use of intelligent agents for the automatic generation of test data. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted an experimental study on four VR applications, and the results showed an accuracy of the solution ranging from 93% to 69%, depending on the complexity of the application tested. We also discussed the feasibility of extending the approach to identify other types of faults in VR applications. In conclusion, we discussed important trends and opportunities that can benefit both academics and practitioners.},

abstract={IntroductionObsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by recurrent, repetitive, and unwanted thoughts or impulses triggering significant anxiety. Exposure and response prevention is currently the first-line therapy for OCD. The goal of this validation study was to confirm the potential of the VR house environment that incorporates OCD-specific items that cluster around major symptom dimensions: ‘contamination’, ‘symmetry’, ‘checking’ and ‘hoarding’ to induce anxiety and compulsive behaviour in patients with OCD.MethodWe assessed a sample of OCD patients (n = 44) that was compared to a group of healthy controls (n = 31). The severity of OCD symptoms was assessed in all subjects. During a single session, participants were asked to approach a set of 10 stimuli (covering four OCD dimensions) and rate their current intensity of distress/anxiety and compulsive tendencies (scales 0–5) provoked by observing each stimulus. Before and after the VR exposure, participants completed questionnaires assessing subjective levels of anxiety (before/after VR exposure), their sense of presence in VR and experienced simulator sickness.ResultsThe results show that the OCD group reports elevated levels of distress and compulsive behaviour when confronted with VR exposure stimuli compared to the control group, but no increase in anxiety levels has been observed after the VR exposure. The subjective ratings of provoked distress and compulsive behaviour are not associated with severity of OCD symptoms, perceived sense of presence, association with cybersickness symptoms is weak.ConclusionOur data suggest that the VR house environment is a suitable tool for VR exposure therapy in OCD patients as it demonstrates OCD symptom provocation relevant for individual patients.},

abstract={Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) is a kind of intracerebral bleeding disease that affects 2.5 per 10,000 people world wide each year. An effective way of curing this disease is to perform a puncture procedure through the dura with a brain puncture drill and tube. The insertion accuracy determines the quality of surgery. Currently, augmented reality—and mixed reality (MR)-based surgical navigation is a promising new technology for surgical navigation in the clinic, aiming to improve the safety and accuracy of surgery. In this study, we present a novel multimodel MR navigation system for HICH surgery. With multi-information fusion technology, organs and hematoma data extracted from CT images can be fused with real patient, which allows surgeons to perform punctures easily. An automatic registration method with a 3D-printed fiducial marker was performed to significantly decrease the time required for surgery preparation.Phantom experiments and user tests were performed in this study, the results of these phantom experiments demonstrated that the mean registration error was 1.18 mm, the insertion error was 1.74 and the average time consumption was 15.9 min, which indicating that this approach was sufficient for clinical application. All the experimental results indicated that this system shows particular promise for use in training inexperienced surgeons, and the next steps would be to refine the system based on the findings with more experienced surgeons.},

abstract={Previous studies showed similar spatial orientation ability (SO) between real world (RW) and virtual reality (VR). As the SO deteriorates with age, it is crucial to investigate whether the degradation is similar in VR, as it may affect the use of VR tools for older people, such as in physical therapy. Therefore, we extended our previous study, in which similar SO between RW and VR was measured for younger participants (18–35 years) with a higher age group (> 55 years) to examine the VR's influence on their SO. Two main tests were conducted. In the first test, the participants were blindfolded, asked to rotate (0°, 45°, 180°, 225°) on a fixed starting position, and walk straight to different objects they had memorized before. This test was conducted twice. An ANOVA only revealed a significant interaction between the factors Age (young/old) and Condition (VR/RW) for the 45°-rotation in the second run. Here, both age groups performed similarly in RW, while in VR, greater deviations in the older participants appeared. Nevertheless, the overall Age*Condition-interaction in the first test was not significant. In the second test, subjects were required to walk blindfolded to two objects starting from different positions. The starting position and objects changed three times in each condition but were equal between RW and VR. No interactions between the factors Age and Condition were found (p > 0.05). Both tests showed a similar influence of VR on the SO of both age groups, supporting the usage of VR, regardless of age.},

abstract={PurposeThe Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FFE) sector is well placed to leverage virtual reality (VR) technology for competitive and operational advantages; however, the diffusion of VR applications in this sector has followed a steep curve. This study reports on the implementation of two novel VR applications in the FFE sector and also investigates the challenges and benefits associated with their use and adaptability.Design/methodology/approachA sequential exploratory mixed research methodology consisting of three phases was adopted for this study. This included identification of factors that affect/facilitate the implementation of VR (Challenges and Benefits) using experiments during in-house prototyping of VR applications, a rigorous literature review and questionnaire survey to solicit FFE Stakeholder's (n = 117) opinion on the utility and usefulness of the proposed applications and to the understand factors that facilitate and inhibit their implementation in FFE's context, particularly as a design communication and coordination tool.FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that distributed and single-user VR has become essential to digitalising the FFE sector's design communication with improved design communication being regarded as the most important benefit of its use. Conversely, the most critical challenge that inhibits the implementation of these two VR applications in the FFE sector is the perceived cost.Originality/valueThis study provides valuable insight to FFE's stakeholders to devise action plans to mitigate myriad complex and interrelated factors that affect the adoption of virtual reality technology in the FFE sector that are otherwise very hard to understand, and the consequential implementation of any mitigation plans cannot be devised.},

abstract={Virtual reality is a form of high‐fidelity simulation that may be used to enhance the quality of medical education. We created a bespoke virtual reality trainer software using high resolution motion capture and ultrasound imagery to teach cognitive‐motor needling skills necessary for the performance of ultrasound‐guided regional anaesthesia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the construct validity between novice and experienced regional anaesthetists. Secondary objectives were: to create learning curves for needling performance; compare the virtual environment immersion with other high‐fidelity virtual reality software; and compare cognitive task loads imposed by the virtual trainer compared with real‐life medical procedures. We recruited 21 novice and 15 experienced participants, each of whom performed 40 needling attempts on four different virtual nerve targets. Performance scores for each attempt were calculated based on measured metrics (needle angulation, withdrawals, time taken) and compared between the groups. The degree of virtual reality immersion was measured using the Presence Questionnaire, and cognitive burden was measured using the NASA‐Task Load Index. Scores by experienced participants were significantly higher than novices (p = 0.002) and for each nerve target (84% vs. 77%, p = 0.002; 86% vs. 79%, p = 0.003; 87% vs. 81%, p = 0.002; 87% vs. 80%, p = 0.003). Log–log transformed learning curves demonstrated individual variability in performance over time. The virtual reality trainer was rated as being comparably immersive to other high‐fidelity virtual reality software in the realism, possibility to act and quality of interface subscales (all p > 0.06) but not in the possibility to examine and self‐performance subscales (all p < 0.009). The virtual reality trainer created workloads similar to those reported in real‐life procedural medicine (p = 0.53). This study achieved initial validation of our new virtual reality trainer and allows progression to a planned definitive trial that will compare the effectiveness of virtual reality training on real‐life regional anaesthesia performance.},

abstract={Research suggests that interpersonal approach-avoidance behaviours influence group evaluations. However, previous work partly neglected the multi-sensory and contextual cues at stake during interpersonal interactions and may offer a limited picture of the phenomenon. Here, we argue that immersive virtual reality (IVR) represents a useful tool to address this issue. In IVR, we implemented interpersonal approach-avoidance behaviours and tested their construct validity. Based on a careful examination of the literature, we defined two construct validity criteria: the evaluative influence of repeated approach-avoidance behaviours as well as the activation of the corresponding neuropsychological systems. In two experiments (NExp1 = 199, NExp2 = 205), we tested whether, compared to avoidance, approach leads to more positive group evaluations on self-report, reaction time based and behavioural intention measures. Additionally, we investigated whether the IVR operationalisations influence the neuropsychological systems assumed to underlie approach-avoidance behaviours. Overall, the findings are not consistent with the hypotheses and do not conclusively validate our IVR approach-avoidance operationalisation. Although additional research should examine more thoroughly the issues raised by the current work by investigating new ways of implementing approach-avoidance in IVR, the present contribution paves the way for such future developments. Despite these challenges, we encourage a consideration of the full-fledged subtleties of social interactions via adequate tools (IVR) for the study of approach-avoidance.},

abstract={Introduction Accurate acetabular cup and femoral stem component orientation are critical for optimising patient outcomes, reducing complications and increasing component longevity following total hip replacement (THR). This study aimed to determine the accuracy of a novel virtual reality (VR) platform in assessing component orientation in a simulated THR model. Methods The VR platform (HTC Vive Pro® system hardware) was compared against the validated Vicon® optical motion capture (MoCap) system. An acetabular cup and femoral stem were manually implanted across a range of orientations into pelvic and femur sawbones, respectively. Simultaneous readings of the acetabular cup operative anteversion (OA) and inclination (OI) and femoral stem alignment (FSA) and neck anteversion (FNA) were obtained from the VR and MoCap systems. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) (Pearson’s r) and linear regression (R2). Results A total of 55 readings were obtained for the acetabular cup and 68 for the femoral stem model. The mean average differences in OA, OI, FSA and FNA between the systems were 3.44°, −0.01°, 0.01° and −0.04°, respectively. Strong positive correlations were demonstrated between both systems in OA, OI, FSA and FNA, with Pearson’s r = 0.92, 0.94, 0.99 and 0.99, and adjusted R2 = 0.82, 0.9, 0.98 and 0.98, respectively. Conclusion The novel VR platform is highly accurate and reliable in determining both acetabular cup and femoral stem component orientations in simulated THR models. This adaptable and cost-effective digital tracking platform may be modified for use in a range of simulated surgical training and educational purposes, particularly in orthopaedic surgery.},

abstract={Background To plan treatment and measure post-stroke recovery, frequent and time-bounded functional assessments are recommended. With increasing needs for neurorehabilitation advances, new technology based methods, such as virtual reality (VR) have emerged. Here, we developed an immersive VR version of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT-VR) to complement neurorehabilitation. Objective This study aimed to assess the validity, usability and test–retest reliability of the ARAT-VR among individuals with stroke, healthcare professionals and healthy control subjects (HCS). Methods Among the 19 items of the ARAT, 13 items were selected and developed in immersive VR. 11 healthcare professionals, 30 individuals with stroke, and 25 HCS were recruited. Content validity was assessed by asking healthcare professionals to rate the difficulty of performing each item of the ARAT-VR in comparison to the classical Action Research Arm Test (ARAT-19). Concurrent validity was first measured using correlation (Spearman tests) between the ARAT-VR and ARAT-19 scores for the individuals with stroke, and second through correlation and comparison between the scores of the ARAT-VR and the reduced version of the ARAT (ARAT-13) for both individuals with stroke and HCS (Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Bland–Altman plots). Usability was measured using the System Usability Scale. A part of individuals with stroke and HCS were re-tested following a convenient delay to measure test–retest reliability (Intra-class correlation and Wilcoxon tests). Results Regarding the content validity, median difficulty of the 13 ARAT-VR items (00 to − 1] to 00–1]) evaluated by healthcare professionals was rated as equivalent to the classical ARAT for all tasks except those involving the marbles. For these, the difficulty was rated as superior to the real tasks (10–1] when pinching with the thumb-index and thumb-middle fingers, and 10–2] when pinching with thumb-ring finger). Regarding the concurrent validity, for paretic hand scores, there were strong correlations between the ARAT-VR and ARAT-13 (r = 0.84), and between the ARAT-VR and ARAT-19 (r = 0.83). Usability (SUS = 82.575–90]) and test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.99; p < 0.001) were excellent. Conclusion The ARAT-VR is a valid, usable and reliable tool that can be used to assess upper limb activity among individuals with stroke, providing potential to increase assessment frequency, remote evaluation, and improve neurorehabilitation.

abstract={This paper contributes to a sustainable construction design management approach to increase the successful renovation rate of existing residential building stock. Indeed, coupling BIM with mixed reality can speed up and improve the quality of the renovation design processes, because it can display virtual models of alternative design scenarios superimposed over the existing physical facility. To this purpose, a sample of technicians was enrolled to test the reliability of this technology. A prototype was developed that enables cooperation among stakeholders and the implementation of an efficient workflow. The volunteers carried out real-life tests in a building demonstrator in Caceres (Spain) and filled in two questionnaires with their feedback. The results showed that an MR-based platform can involve interested stakeholders in the assessment of renovation design projects, that speeds up the decision-making process and increases the quality of those projects. Moreover, technicians can master the technology quickly, provided that it is included in the current renovation workflow and some technology gaps are covered. However, the main limitations of this study are that these findings are valid for building renovation design only, and the tests were performed in a controlled, yet full scale, experimental environment. Finally, this paper deals with a few open technical issues, such as the efficient alignment of holograms, transformation of BIM models into a format suitable for mixed reality applications and sharing feedbacks in an on-line repository to foster collaboration.},

abstract={Purpose: To report the application of LUXIE and validate its reliability by comparing the test results with those of Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 (HFA3). Methods: In this pilot study, we prospectively recruited participants who had received HFA3 SITA standard 30-2 perimetry and tested them with LUXIE on the same day. LUXIE is a software designed for visual field testing cooperating with HTC Vive Pro Eye, a head-mounted virtual reality device with an eye-tracking system. The test stimuli were synchronized with eye movements captured by the eye-tracking system to eliminate fixation loss. The global, hemifields, quadrants, glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) sectors, and point-by-point retinal sensitivities were compared between LUXIE and HFA3. All participants were asked to fill out a post-test user survey. Results: Thirty-eight participants with 65 eyes were enrolled. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3 in global (r = 0.81), superior hemifield (r = 0.77), superonasal, superotemporal, and inferonasal quadrants (r = 0.80, 0.78, 0.80). The user survey showed that participants were more satisfied with LUXIE in operating difficulty, comfortability, time perception, concentration, and overall satisfaction. Conclusions: LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3. Fixation loss could be eliminated in LUXIE with the eye-tracking system. The application of virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye makes telemedicine and even home-based self-screening visual field tests possible. Key Messages: 1. Virtual reality perimetry is a developing technology that has the potential in telemedicine, and home self-screening visual field tests. 2. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 in visual field retinal sensitivities.},

abstract={Evacuation signs are one of the key factors which influence the building evacuation efficiency and evacuees’ route choice behaviors. It is important to test the effectiveness of evacuation signs, and an eye movement test was verified to be a good way. In this paper, both reality and MR (Mixed-Reality) evacuation experiments were carried out to collect the eye movement data of participants, such as gaze position, fixation duration, and number of gazes. In the reality experiment, participants took part in an emergency evacuation at a T-junction corridor with the glass-type eye-tracking device. In order to collect eye movement data in the MR experiment, the eye tracking device was integrated into the Microsoft HoloLens device (MR-ET for short). In either reality or MR experiments, each participant took part in five sub-experiments with five different types of evacuation signs. It was found that (1) the evacuation signs with a black background, green foreground and flashing lights have a better effect in guidance; (2) the flashing lights can better attract the attention of the participants, and enhanced the participants’ understanding of the signs. (3) An X-mark will hinder participants’ understanding of the signs and increase their reaction time. According to the results of the experiments, it is also found that the eye-tracking test in an MR environment is also a good method to test the effectiveness of the evacuation signs, and such a method can also be used in building safety design without damaging a wall or changing the reality environment of a building.},

abstract={Background Mixed Reality technology may provide many advantages over traditional teaching methods. Despite its potential, the technology has yet to be used for the formal assessment of clinical competency. This study sought to collect validity evidence and assess the feasibility of using the HoloLens 2 mixed reality headset for the conduct and augmentation of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted to compare the assessment of undergraduate medical students undertaking OSCEs via HoloLens 2 live (HLL) and recorded (HLR), and gold-standard in-person (IP) methods. An augmented mixed reality scenario was also assessed. Results Thirteen undergraduate participants completed a total of 65 OSCE stations. Overall inter-modality correlation was 0.81 (p = 0.01), 0.98 (p = 0.01) and 0.82 (p = 0.01) for IP vs. HLL, HLL vs. HLR and IP vs. HLR respectively. Skill based correlations for IP vs. HLR were assessed for history taking (0.82, p = 0.01), clinical examination (0.81, p = 0.01), procedural (0.88, p = 0.01) and clinical skills (0.92, p = 0.01), and assessment of a virtual mixed reality patient (0.74, p = 0.01). The HoloLens device was deemed to be usable and practical (Standard Usability Scale (SUS) score = 51.5), and the technology was thought to deliver greater flexibility and convenience, and have the potential to expand and enhance assessment opportunities. Conclusions HoloLens 2 is comparable to traditional in-person examination of undergraduate medical students for both live and recorded assessments, and therefore is a valid and robust method for objectively assessing performance. The technology is in its infancy, and users need to develop confidence in its usability and reliability as an assessment tool. However, the potential to integrate additional functionality including holographic content, automated tracking and data analysis, and to facilitate remote assessment may allow the technology to enhance, expand and standardise examinations across a range of educational contexts.},

abstract={Neuropsychological screening tools for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been widely used. However, to date, their sensitivity and specificity still remain unsatisfied. This study aims to investigate whether spatial memory can discriminate MCI better than neuropsychological screening tools. A total of 56 healthy older adults and 36 older adults with MCI participated in this study; they performed a spatial cognitive task based on virtual reality (SCT-VR), the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-K), and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design Test (WAIS-BDT). The discriminant power was compared between the SCT-VR and the MoCA-K, and the reliability and validity of the SCT-VR were analyzed. The spatial memory, assessed by the SCT-VR, showed better sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity: 0.944; specificity: 0.964) than the MoCA-K (sensitivity: 0.857; specificity: 0.746). The test-retest reliability of the SCT-VR was relatively high (ICCs: 0.982, p < 0.001) and the concurrent validity of the SCT-VR with the MoCA-K (r = −0.587, p < 0.001) and the WAIS-BDT (r = −0.594, p < 0.001) was statistically significant. These findings shed light on the importance of spatial memory as a behavioral marker of MCI. The ecologically validated spatial memory tasks based on VR need to be investigated by neuroscientific studies in the future.},

abstract={This study investigates the impact of an efficacy-focused virtual reality (VR) intervention designed according to instructional design principles on eating behavior. In the preregistered intervention study, psychology students were randomly assigned to nine seminar blocks. Employing parallel design, they were allocated to either a VR intervention to experience the environmental impact of food behavior (1) and alter the future by revising food choices (2) or to a passive control condition. The data from 123 participants (78% female, mean age 25.03, SD = 6.4) were analyzed to investigate the effect of the VR intervention on dietary footprint measured from 1 week before to 1 week after the intervention. The VR intervention decreased individual dietary footprints (d = 0.4) significantly more than the control condition. Similarly, the VR condition increased response efficacy and knowledge to a larger extent compared to the control. For knowledge, the effect persisted for 1 week. The VR intervention had no impact on intentions, self-efficacy, or psychological distance. Additional manipulation of normative feedback enhanced self-efficacy; however, manipulation of geographical framing did not influence psychological distance.

abstract={Spatial navigation impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been suggested to underlie patients experiencing spatial disorientation. Though many studies have highlighted navigation impairments for AD patients in virtual reality (VR) environments, the extent to which these impairments predict a patient’s risk for spatial disorientation in the real world is still poorly understood. The aims of this study were to (a) investigate the spatial navigation abilities of AD patients in VR environments as well as in a real world community setting and (b) explore whether we could predict patients at a high risk for spatial disorientation in the community based on their VR navigation. Sixteen community-dwelling AD patients and 21 age/gender matched controls were assessed on their egocentric and allocentric navigation abilities in VR environments using the Virtual Supermarket Test (VST) and Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) as well as in the community using the Detour Navigation Test (DNT). When compared to controls, AD patients exhibited impairments on the VST, SHQ, and DNT. For patients, only SHQ wayfinding distance and wayfinding duration significantly predicted composite disorientation score on the DNT (β = 0.422, p = 0.034, R2 = 0.299 and β = 0.357, p = 0.046, R2 = 0.27 respectively). However, these same VR measures could not reliably predict which patients were at highest risk of spatial disorientation in the community (p > 0.1). Future studies should focus on developing VR-based tests which can predict AD patients at high risk of getting spatially disorientated in the real world.},

Using virtual reality technology to improve the basic structure of building space, reorganize the form through the design space, and optimize the design of the concrete structure building space function; based on the test model of virtual reality technology, design the matching method of concrete structure, increase the proportion of building space optimization, and adopt linear buckling method, geometric nonlinear method, and double nonlinear analysis method; the ultimate bearing capacity of steel structures of residential buildings in earthquake areas is tested. Experimental results show that for the simple structure building space, the average optimization ratios are 97.17% and 96.71%, respectively; for the complex structure building space, under the proposed optimization design, the average optimization ratio is maintained at 94.34%, and the error between the stress prediction value of the finite element model and the axial stress obtained by testing is less than 6%. Compared with the traditional space optimization design, in the proposed space optimization design method, the proportion of building space optimization is higher; it can be seen that the virtual reality technology has a better matching effect on the concrete structure, and the accuracy of the ultimate bearing capacity value obtained by prediction is high.},

abstract={Immersive virtual reality (VR) is increasingly applied in various areas of life. The potential of this technology has also been noticed in recreational physical activity and sports. It appears that a virtual environment can also be used in diagnosing certain psychomotor abilities. The main aim of this study consisted of assessing the relevance and reliability of VR-implemented tests of simple and complex reaction time (RT) performed by mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters. Thirty-two professional MMA fighters were tested. The original test developed in the virtual environment was applied for RT assessment. The fighters’ task consisted of reacting to the lighting up of a virtual disc situated in front of them by pushing a controller button. The relevance of the test task was estimated by juxtaposing the obtained results with the classic computer test used for measuring simple and complex reactions, while its reliability was assessed with the intraclass correlation procedure. Significant relationships found between the results of VR-implemented tests and computer-based tests confirmed the relevance of the new tool for the assessment of simple and complex RT. In the context of their reliability, RT tests in VR do not differ from tests conducted with the use of standard computer-based tools. VR technology enables the creation of tools that are useful in diagnosing psychomotor abilities. Reaction time tests performed by MMA fighters with the use of VR can be considered relevant, and their reliability is similar to the reliability obtained in computer-based tests.},

abstract={Gait deficits are often persistent after stroke, and current rehabilitation methods do not restore normal gait for everyone. Targeted methods of focused gait therapy that meet the individual needs of each stroke survivor are needed. Our objective was to develop and test a combination protocol of simultaneous brain stimulation and focused stance phase training for people with chronic stroke (>6 months). We combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with targeted stance phase therapy using Virtual Reality (VR)-assisted treadmill training and overground practice. The training was guided by motor learning principles. Five users (>6 months post-stroke with stance phase gait deficits) completed 10 treatment sessions. Each session began with 30 min of VR-assisted treadmill training designed to apply motor learning (ML)-based stance phase targeted practice. During the first 15 min of the treadmill training, bihemispheric tDCS was simultaneously delivered. Immediately after, users completed 30 min of overground (ML)-based gait training. The outcomes included the feasibility of protocol administration, gait speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), paretic limb stance phase control capability, and the Fugl–Meyer for lower extremity coordination (FMLE). The changes in the outcome measures (except the assessments of stance phase control capability) were calculated as the difference from baseline. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed after 10 treatment sessions in gait speed (0.25 ± 0.11 m/s) and FGA (4.55 ± 3.08 points). Statistically significant improvements were observed in TUG (2.36 ± 3.81 s) and FMLE (4.08 ± 1.82 points). A 10-session intervention combining tDCS and ML-based task-specific gait rehabilitation was feasible and produced clinically meaningful improvements in lower limb function in people with chronic gait deficits after stroke. Because only five users tested the new protocol, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population. As a contribution to the field, we developed and tested a protocol combining brain stimulation and ML-based stance phase training for individuals with chronic stance phase deficits after stroke. The protocol was feasible to administer; statistically and/or clinically significant improvements in gait function across an array of gait performance measures were observed with this relatively short treatment protocol.},

abstract={Collaborative robots (cobots) could help humans in tasks that are mundane, dangerous or where direct human contact carries risk. Yet, the collaboration between humans and robots is severely limited by the aspects of the safety and comfort of human operators. In this paper, we outline the use of extended reality (XR) as a way to test and develop collaboration with robots. We focus on virtual reality (VR) in simulating collaboration scenarios and the use of cobot digital twins. This is specifically useful in situations that are difficult or even impossible to safely test in real life, such as dangerous scenarios. We describe using XR simulations as a means to evaluate collaboration with robots without putting humans at harm. We show how an XR setting enables combining human behavioral data, subjective self-reports, and biosignals signifying human comfort, stress and cognitive load during collaboration. Several works demonstrate XR can be used to train human operators and provide them with augmented reality (AR) interfaces to enhance their performance with robots. We also provide a first attempt at what could become the basis for a human–robot collaboration testing framework, specifically for designing and testing factors affecting human–robot collaboration. The use of XR has the potential to change the way we design and test cobots, and train cobot operators, in a range of applications: from industry, through healthcare, to space operations.},

Product tests in VR have many advantages, such as reproducibility and shortened development time. In this paper, we investigate the virtual testing of a collision avoidance system for drones in terms of economic benefits. Our results show that virtual tests had both positive and negative effects on the development, with the positive aspects clearly predominating. In summary, the tests in VR shorten the development time and reduce risks and therefore costs. Furthermore, they offer possibilities not available in real-world tests.

abstract={With the introduction of new devices, industries are turning to virtual reality to innovate their product development processes. However, before the technology’s possibilities can be fully harnessed, certain constraints must be overcome. This study identifies the benefits and challenges of virtual-reality-based usability testing and design reviews in industry through a patents and articles review. We searched Derwent Innovation, Scopus, and Web of Science and identified 7 patent filings and 20 articles. We discovered an increase in patent filings since 2016 and strong development in the technology space, offering opportunities to enter an area while it is still young. The most frequently researched field is the automotive industry and the most used device is the HTC VIVE head-mounted display, which is frequently paired with motion capture systems and Unity 3D game engines. Virtual reality benefits design reviews and usability testing by providing the visualization of new angles that stimulate novel insights, increasing team engagement, offering more intuitive interactions for non-CAD specialists, saving redesign cost and time, and increasing participants’ safety. The challenges faced by virtual-reality-based prototypes are a lack of realism due to unnatural tactile and visual interactions, latency and registration issues, communication difficulties between teams, and unpleasant symptoms. While these constraints prevent virtual reality from replacing conventional design reviews and usability testing in the near future, it is already a valuable contribution to the industrial product development process.},

abstract={The need for objective data-driven usability testing of VR applications is becoming more tangible with the rapid development of numerous VR applications and their increased accessibility. Traditional methods of testing are too time and resource consuming and might provide results that are highly subjective. Thus, the aim of this article is to explore the possibility of automation of usability testing of VR applications by using objective features such as HMD built-in head and hands tracking, EEG sensor, video recording, and other measurable parameters in addition to automated analysis of subjective data provided in questionnaires. For this purpose, a simple VR application was created which comprised relatively easy tasks that did not generate stress for the users. Fourteen volunteers took part in the study and their signals were monitored to acquire objective automated data. At the same time the observer was taking notes of subjects’ behaviour, and their subjective opinions about the experience were recorded in a post-experiment questionnaire. The results acquired from signal monitoring and questionnaires were juxtaposed with observation and post-interview results to confirm the validity and efficacy of automated usability testing. The results were very promising, proving that automated usability testing of VR applications is potentially achievable.},

abstract={Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that has been used to provide the Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) illusion to patients with promising results. In the present work, the goal is to design, develop and test a portable VR-based MVF system that monitors behavioral information about the performance of a simple motor task. The developed application runs in a stand-alone VR system and allows the researcher to select the real and virtual hands used to perform the motor task. The system was evaluated with a group of twenty healthy volunteers (12 men and 8 women) with ages between 18 and 66 years. Participants had to repetitively perform a motor task in four different experimental conditions: two mirror conditions (performing real movements with the dominant and with the non-dominant hand) and two non-mirror conditions. A significant effect of the experimental condition on embodiment score (p < 0.001), response time (p < 0.001), performance time (p < 0.001), trajectory length (p < 0.004) and trajectory maximum horizontal deviation (p < 0.001) was observed. Furthermore, a significant effect of the experimental moment (initial, middle and final parts of the training) on the performance time was observed (p < 0.001). These results show that the monitored parameters provide relevant information to evaluate the participant’s task performance in different experimental conditions.},

abstract={Background After a stroke, experts recommend regular monitoring and kinematic assessments of patients to objectively measure motor recovery. With the rise of new technologies and increasing needs for neurorehabilitation, an interest in virtual reality has emerged. In this context, we have developed an immersive virtual reality version of the Box and Block Test (BBT-VR). The aim of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of the BBT-VR among patients with stroke and healthy participants. Methods Twenty-three healthy participants and 22 patients with stroke were asked to perform the classical Box and Block Test (BBT) and BBT-VR three times with both hands. Concurrent validity was assessed through correlations between these two tests and reliability of the BBT-VR through correlation on test–retest. Usability of the BBT-VR was also evaluated with the System Usability Scale. Hand kinematic data extracted from controller’s 3D position allowed to compute mean velocity (Vmean), peak velocity (Vpeak) and smoothness (SPARC). Results Results showed strong correlations between the number of blocks displaced with the BBT and the BBT-VR among patients with stroke for affected (r = 0.89; p  0.8; p < 0.001) and usability almost excellent (System Usability Scale = 79 ± 12.34%). On average participants moved between 30 and 40% less blocks during the BBT-VR than during the BBT. Healthy participants demonstrated significantly higher kinematic measures (Vmean = 0.22 ± 0.086 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.96 ± 0.341 ms−1; SPARC = − 3.31 ± 0.862) than patients with stroke (Vmean = 0.12 ± 0.052 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.60 ± 0.202 ms−1; SPARC = − 5.04− 7.050 to − 3.682]). Conclusion The BBT-VR is a usable, valid and reliable test to assess manual dexterity, providing kinematic parameters, in a population of patients with stroke and healthy participants.

abstract={Stroke, affecting approximately 15 million people worldwide, has long been a global cause of death and disability. Virtual Reality (VR) has shown its potential as an assistive tool for post-stroke rehabilitation. The objective of this pilot study was to define the task-specific performance metrics of VR tasks to assess the performance level of healthy subjects and patients quantitatively and to obtain their feedback for improving the developed framework. A pilot prospective study was designed. We tested the designed VR tasks on forty healthy right-handed subjects to evaluate its potential. Qualitative trajectory plots and three quantitative performance metrics—time taken to complete the task, percentage relative error, and trajectory smoothness—were computed from the recorded data of forty healthy subjects. Two patients with stroke were also enrolled to compare their performance with healthy subjects. Each participant received one VR session of 90 min. No adverse effects were noticed throughout the study. Performance metrics obtained from healthy subjects were used as a reference for patients. Relatively higher values of task completion time and trajectory smoothness and lower values of relative % error was observed for the affected hands w.r.t the unaffected hands of both the patients. For the unaffected hands of both the patients, the performance levels were found objectively closer to that of healthy subjects. A library of VR tasks for wrist and fingers were designed, and task-specific performance metrics were defined in this study. The evaluation of the VR exercises using these performance metrics will help the clinicians to assess the patient’s progress quantitatively and to design the rehabilitation framework for a future clinical study.},

abstract={Background Mastery of technical skills is one of the fundamental goals of surgical training for novices. Meanwhile, performing laparoscopic procedures requires exceptional surgical skills compared to open surgery. However, it is often difficult for trainees to learn through observation and practice only. Virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation is expanding and rapidly advancing. A major obstacle for laparoscopic trainees is the difficulty of well-performed dissection. Therefore, we developed a new VR simulation system, Lap-PASS LP-100, which focuses on training to create proper tension on the tissue in laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy dissection. This study aimed to validate this new VR simulation system. Methods A total of 50 participants were asked to perform medial dissection of the meso-sigmoid colon on the VR simulator. Forty-four surgeons and six non-medical professionals working in the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan, were enrolled in this study. The surgeons were: laparoscopic surgery experts with > 100 laparoscopic surgeries (LS), 21 were novices with experience < 100 LS, and five without previous experience in LS. The participants’ surgical performance was evaluated by three blinded raters using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS). Results There were significant differences (P-values < 0.044) in all GOALS items between the non-medical professionals and surgeons. The experts were significantly superior to the novices in one item of GOALS: efficiency (4(4–5) vs. 4(3–4)], with a 95% confidence interval, p = 0.042). However, both bimanual dexterity and total score in the experts were not statistically different but tended to be higher than in the novices. Conclusions Our study demonstrated a full validation of our new system. This could detect the surgeons' ability to perform surgical dissection and suggest that this VR simulator could be an effective training tool. This surgical VR simulator might have tremendous potential to enhance training for surgeons.},

abstract={SummaryPurposeThe purpose of this study was to develop a novel mouth contactless breathing exercise solution based on virtual reality (VR), and to test its feasibility.MethodsWe developed the Virtual Reality-based Breathing Exercise System (VR-BRES), a self-regulating biofeedback breathing exercise with gaming characteristics and a soft stretch sensor. The feasibility and efficacy of the VR-BRES prototype were investigated through a randomized crossover trial. Fifty healthy adults participated in the trial, and their respiratory parameters and user evaluation of the VR-BRES were compared with conventional deep breathing (CDB) exercises.ResultsThe respiratory parameters, forced vital capacity (Z = 4.82, 4.95, p < .001), forced expiratory volume in one second (t = 6.02, 6.26, p < .001), and peak expiratory flow (t = 5.35, 5.68, p < .001) were significantly higher during breathing exercises using the VR-BRES. User evaluation was also significantly higher for the VR-BRES in terms of efficiency (Z = 3.86, p < .001), entertainingness (Z = 5.00, p < .001), and intention to use (Z = 3.22, p = .001) compared to CDB. However, there was no difference in convenience between the two methods (Z = −0.90, p = .369).ConclusionThe VR-BRES has the potential to be an efficient breathing exercise solution. We recommend a clinical study that evaluates the effects of the VR-BRES for a certain period of time for people who need breathing exercises.},

abstract={Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in heathy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artefacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.},

abstract={In a healthcare context, the success of a fire safety procedure in a real-life emergency mainly depends on staff decisions and actions. One of the factors influencing staff decision-making is their training. In most healthcare facilities, safety educators use slide-based lectures as a training tool. Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining fire safety community attention for being an interesting training tool. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of VR-based fire safety training simulators compared with a slide-based lecture. The present research proposes a novel non-immersive VR-based training for healthcare fire safety education. This paper describes the prototyping steps required to develop a non-immersive VR serious game (SG) to train the staff of Vincent Van Gogh (VVG) hospital in Belgium. The paper finally validates the VR SG comparing its effectiveness against slide-based lecture training. 78 staff from VVG hospital in Belgium participated in this study. They were divided into two groups: Group A was trained using a slide-based lecture, and Group B was trained using the VR SG. The results indicated that the VR SG was more effective than the slide-based lecture in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention and in terms of self-efficacy increment in short and long terms than the slide-based lecture.},

abstract={PurposeTo determine whether childhood intermittent exotropia (IXT) affects distance divergence and performance in block-building tasks within a virtual reality (VR) environment.MethodsThirty-nine children with IXT, aged 6–12 years, who underwent muscle surgery and 37 normal controls were enrolled. Children were instructed to watch the target moving away and perform a block-building task while fitted with a VR head-mounted display equipped with eye- and hand-movement tracking systems. The change in inter-ocular distance with binocular distance viewing, time to stack five cube blocks of different sizes in order, and distance disparities between the largest and farthest cubes were assessed. All children were evaluated at baseline and 3-month time points.ResultsThe patients with IXT exhibited a larger distance divergence than did controls (p = 0.024), which was associated with greater distance angle of deviation and poorer distance control (r = 0.350, p = 0.001 and r = 0.349, p = 0.004). At baseline, the patients with IXT showed larger distance disparities in the block-building task than did controls in terms of the horizontal, vertical, and 3-dimensional (3-D) measurements (all ps < 0.050). Larger horizontal disparity was associated with greater distance angle of deviation (r = 0.383, p = 0.037). Three months after surgery, the horizontal and 3-D disparities in the patients with IXT improved significantly and were not comparably different compared with controls.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that VR-based block-building task may be useful in testing possible deficits in visuo-motor skills associated with childhood IXT.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) provides the potential for immersive and engaging training solutions for improving sport performance. However, if VR training is to be adopted and used in an effective and evidence-based fashion, a more rigorous assessment of the validity of the simulation is required. Construct validity is the degree to which the simulation provides an accurate representation of core features of the task. In the context of sport, if the training drills in the VR environment are a true representation of the skills needed in the real world, then those that excel at the sport in the real world should also excel in the virtual one. In this experiment, we examined the construct validity of a soccer-specific VR simulator by recruiting professional, academy, and novice players. Seventeen participants in each group completed four VR soccer drills, and the VR software provided scores relating to performance and process (e.g., passing accuracy, composure, reaction time, and adaptability). Based on these scores, an algorithm gave a diagnostic score relating to the predicted ability of the player. Results showed that this VR platform successfully differentiated between participants of differing skill levels. These results provide some support for the construct validity of this VR simulator and suggest at least partial overlap between the perceptual-cognitive and motor skills needed to perform well across ‘real’ and virtual environments. Further work is needed to explore the validity and fidelity of the simulation before its adoption as a training device can be fully endorsed.},

abstract={To address a deficiency of scales measuring attitudes toward virtual reality technology, the Attitudes toward Virtual Reality Technology Scale (AVRTS) was developed following a three-step procedure. Items were generated based on literature and in a focus group pilot study (n = 20). Using factor analysis with maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation, the initial scale was created after administration of these items (n = 314) and further refined after a second survey (n = 473). In the final solution, a total of 22 items clustered into a three-factor solution with the factors being “ease of use” (alpha = .858), “usefulness” (alpha = .857), and “enjoyment” (alpha = .919) and overall reliability of .910. Construct validity was established by correlating the AVRTS with the Technology Readiness Index and an access barrier scale, and internal validity was established by correlating the scale with its sub-scales.},

abstract={Gait training in a virtual reality (VR) environment is promising for children affected by different disorders. However, the efficacy of VR therapy is still under debate, and more research is needed to clarify its effects on clinical conditions. The combination of VR with neuroimaging methods, such as the electroencephalography (EEG), might help in answering this need. The aim of the present work was to set up and test a system for the multimodal analysis of the gait pattern during VR gait training of pediatric populations by analyzing the EEG correlates as well as the kinematic and kinetic parameters of the gait. An EEG system was integrated with the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab (GRAIL). We developed and validated, with healthy adults (n = 5) and children (n = 4, healthy or affected by cerebral palsy (CP)), the hardware and software integration of the two systems, which allowed the synchronization of the acquired signals and a reliable identification of the initial contact (IC) of each gait cycle, showing good sensitivity and critical success index values. Moreover, we tested the multimodal acquisition by successfully analyzing EEG data and kinematic and kinetic parameters of one healthy child and one child with CP. This system gives the possibility of monitoring the effect of the VR therapy and studying the neural correlates of gait.},

abstract={Prior laboratory experiments among healthy samples found that training avoidance movements to angry faces may lower anger and aggression, especially people high in trait anger. To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, the present researchers developed it into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). The current study examined the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 30). In addition to the aggression replacement training, patients played either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Aggressive behavior was measured pre-, half-way, and post-treatment via self-report and clinicians ratings. No difference was found between the VR-GAIME and the control game. However, the participants reported gaining more insight into their own behavior and that of others. Future VR intervention tools in clinical settings may capitalize more on their benefits for self-reflection within interpersonal settings.},

abstract={Although VR technology can provide an ideal learning and application environment for learners’ language skill acquisition, the learning performance of different types of learners in virtual environments and differences in their knowledge transfer ability from the virtual to the real environment still need further discussion. Therefore, we developed a VR English speaking training and testing system to understand the influence of cognitive style and test environment on the learners’ learning effect. The results indicated that: (1) the learning effect of the field-independent learners was lower than that of the field-dependent learners in the real testing environment, but significantly higher than that of the field-dependent learners in the virtual testing environment. Meanwhile, there was a more significant difference in the real and virtual learning effect between the field-dependent and field-independent learners; (2) there was a significant interaction between cognitive style and test environment in the learners’ learning effect. Besides, cognitive style and test environment had an influence on the spoken English learning effect based on VR. The field-independent learners were more likely to transfer what they had learned in the virtual environment to the real application.},

abstract={Student life causes many sources of stress due to the requirements of managing schoolwork, family, friends, health and wellbeing, and future career planning. Some students are overwhelmed and lack resilience to overcome stress, especially if they are inexperienced in managing setbacks, fail to achieve expectations, or lack skills to independently manage social skills, recreation, and study time. The long-term accumulation of stress has a negative impact on students’ physical and mental health, and may lead to a range of symptoms such as depression, anxiety, headache, insomnia, and eating disorders. Although most universities provide psychological counseling services, there is often a shortage of professional psychologists, which leads to students suffering from stress for longer than necessary without immediate assistance. The build-up of stress can lead to tragic consequences including abnormal reasoning, anti-social behavior, and suicide. There should never be a need for a student to wait more than a month to make an appointment for counseling services and every request for help should be immediately addressed and assessed. In this research, we designed a unique test platform for an immersive virtual reality group chatbot counseling system so students can receive psychological help and stress management counseling anytime and anywhere. First, the research used questionnaires to measure the stress levels and identifies how stress affects their lives. An immersive virtual reality chatbot was developed using professional psychological counseling knowledge that can provide answers during individual or group counseling sessions. Students can log in to the platform as avatars and ask the chatbot questions or interact with other students on the platform. This research provides college students with a new technology-based counseling environment designed to help relieve stress and learn new ways to improve student life quality from others. The platform provides a test base for future clinical trials to evaluate and improve the automated virtual reality chatbot counseling system.},

abstract={Objective. To explore the construction of immersive learning system based on virtual reality (VR) and test its learning effect. Methods. 20 qualified subjects were divided into two groups, each tending to agree, each with 5 boys and 5 girls. Experimental group 1 is in the real operating environment, and experimental group 2 is in the VR virtual disassembly experimental environment. The task process errors, knowledge questionnaire scores and user subjective satisfaction were analyzed statistically. Results. The significance probability P of knowledge questionnaire in the Levene test was 0.777, greater than 0.05, and the variance homogeneous, so the final P of independent sample t-test was subject to “assumed variance equal”; the significance probability was 0.613, greater than 0.05; the questionnaire scores of two groups showed no significant difference, so VR virtual environment can achieve the learning effect of the real environment. The number of errors in a VR virtual situation is significantly lower than the number of errors in the real environment, the VR virtual environment can achieve the learning effect of the real environment, and the VR virtual environment can achieve more interaction, with good interaction. Conclusion. The immersive learning system based on VR detection technology can realize the cognition of three-dimensional model structure and has a certain learning effect.},

abstract={The different pathways between the position of a near-infrared camera and the user’s eye limit the use of existing near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems for tumor margin assessments. By utilizing an optical system that precisely matches the near-infrared fluorescence image and the optical path of visible light, we developed an augmented reality (AR)-based fluorescence imaging system that provides users with a fluorescence image that matches the real-field, without requiring any additional algorithms. Commercial smart glasses, dichroic beam splitters, mirrors, and custom near-infrared cameras were employed to develop the proposed system, and each mount was designed and utilized. After its performance was assessed in the laboratory, preclinical experiments involving tumor detection and lung lobectomy in mice and rabbits by using indocyanine green (ICG) were conducted. The results showed that the proposed system provided a stable image of fluorescence that matched the actual site. In addition, preclinical experiments confirmed that the proposed system could be used to detect tumors using ICG and evaluate lung lobectomies. The AR-based intraoperative smart goggle system could detect fluorescence images for tumor margin assessments in animal models, without disrupting the surgical workflow in an operating room. Additionally, it was confirmed that, even when the system itself was distorted when worn, the fluorescence image consistently matched the actual site.},

abstract={Background: Although various technologies are used to evaluate driving skill, there are some limitations such as the limited range of the monitor and the possible risk of causing cybersickness. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in the hazard perception and cybersickness experienced between novice and experienced drivers measured in a VR hazard perception test with a head-mounted display (HMD). Methods: The novice (n = 32) and the experienced drivers (n = 36) participated in the hazard perception test through the VR of an HMD. Results: The total number of identified hazards was 1071 in the novice drivers and 1376 in the experienced drivers. Two of the hazards appeared to be only identifiable through the HMD. A chi-square test revealed that experienced drivers were more likely to identify the hazards than the novice drivers (p 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the VR hazard perception test may be useful for evaluating patients’ driving skills.},

abstract={Background Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a condition characterized by chronic subjective dizziness and exacerbated by visual stimuli or upright movement. Typical balance tests do not replicate the environments known to increase symptoms in people with PPPD—crowded places with moving objects. Using a virtual reality system, we quantified dynamic balance in people with PPPD and healthy controls in diverse visual conditions. Methods Twenty-two individuals with PPPD and 29 controls performed a square-shaped fast walking task (Four-Square Step Test Virtual Reality—FSST-VR) using a head-mounted-display (HTC Vive) under 3 visual conditions (empty train platform; people moving; people and trains moving). Head kinematics was used to measure task duration, movement smoothness and anterior–posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) ranges of movement (ROM). Heart rate (HR) was monitored using a chest-band. Participants also completed a functional mobility test (Timed-Up-and-Go; TUG) and questionnaires measuring anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI), balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence; ABC), perceived disability (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) and simulator sickness (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). Main effects of visual load and group and associations between performance, functional and self-reported outcomes were examined. Results State anxiety and simulator sickness did not increase following testing. AP-ROM and HR increased with high visual load in both groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in head kinematics. In the high visual load conditions, high trait anxiety and longer TUG duration were moderately associated with reduced AP and ML-ROM in the PPPD group and low ABC and high perceived disability were associated with reduced AP-ROM (|r| =  0.47 to 0.53; p < 0.05). In contrast, in controls high STAI-trait, low ABC and longer TUG duration were associated with increased AP-ROM (|r| = 0.38 to 0.46; p < 0.05) and longer TUG duration was associated with increased ML-ROM (r = 0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusions FSST-VR may shed light on movement strategies in PPPD beyond task duration. While no main effect of group was observed, the distinct associations with self-reported and functional outcomes, identified using spatial head kinematics, suggest that some people with PPPD reduce head degrees of freedom when performing a dynamic balance task. This supports a potential link between spatial perception and PPPD symptomatology.},

abstract={Purpose: To test the ability of a virtual reality (VR) orientation and mobility (O&M) protocol to serve a measure of functional vision for patients with inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). Methods: A VR-O&M protocol designed using a commercially available VR hardware was tested in normally sighted control subjects (n=7; ages 10– 35yo; Average 22.5yo) and patients with RPE65-associated Leber Congenital Amaurosis (n=3; ages 7– 18yo; Average 12.7yo), in two of them before and after gene therapy. Patients underwent perimetry and full-field sensitivity testing. VR-O&M parameters correlated with the visual dysfunction. Results: Visual acuities in RPE65 patients were on average worse than 20/200, dark-adapted sensitivity losses > 5 log units, and fields constricted between 20° and 40°. Before treatment, patients required ∼ 1000-fold brighter environment to navigate, had at least x4 more collisions, and were slower both to orient and navigate compared to control subjects. Improvements in cone- (by 1– 2 L.u.) and rod-mediated (by > 4 L.u.) sensitivities post-treatment led to fewer collisions (at least by half) at ∼ 100-fold dimmer luminances, and to x4 times faster navigation times. Conclusion: This study provides proof-of-concept data in support for the use of VR-O&M systems to quantify the impact that the visual dysfunction and improvement of vision following treatments has on functional vision in IRDs. The VR-O&M was useful in potentially challenging scenarios such as in pediatric patients with severe IRDs. Translational Relevance: A VR-O&M test will provide much needed flexibility, both in its deployment as well as in the possibility to test various attributes of vision that may be impacted by gene therapy in the setting of translational studies. Precis: This study provides proof-of-concept data in support for the use of a virtual reality orientation and mobility test to quantify the impact of the disease and of treatments thereof on functional vision in inherited retinal degenerations.},

abstract={Subjective visual vertical (SVV) and subjective visual horizontal (SVH) tests can be used to evaluate the perception of verticality and horizontality, respectively, and can aid the diagnosis of otolith dysfunction in clinical practice. In this study, SVV and SVH screen version tests are implemented using virtual reality (VR) equipment; the proposed test method promotes a more immersive feeling for the subject while using a simple equipment configuration and possessing excellent mobility. To verify the performance of the proposed VR-based SVV and SVH tests, a reliable comparison was made between the traditional screen-based SVV and SVH tests and the proposed method, based on 30 healthy subjects. The average results of our experimental tests on the VR-based binocular SVV and SVH equipment were −0.15° ± 1.74 and 0.60° ± 1.18, respectively. The proposed VR-based method satisfies the normal tolerance for horizontal or vertical lines, i.e., a ±3° error, as defined in previous studies, and it can be used to replace existing test methods.},

abstract={Background We previously proposed a novel virtual reality-based method to assess human field of perception (FOP) and field of regard (FOR), termed the FOPR test. This study assessed the diagnostic validity of the FOPR test for hemispatial neglect (HSN). Methods We included 19 stroke patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere and with HSN (HSN+SS), 22 stroke patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere and without HSN (HSN−SS), and 22 healthy controls aged 19–65 years. The success rate (SR) and response time (RT) in the FOPR test for both FOP and FOR were assessed (FOP-SR, FOR-SR, FOP-RT, and FOR-RT, respectively). Using a Bland–Altman plot, agreements between the FOPR test and conventional tests were confirmed, and the FOPR test accuracy was verified using the support vector machine (SVM). Measured values were analysed using ANOVA and Kruskall–Wallis tests for group comparison. Results The Bland–Altman plot showed good agreement between FOPR test and conventional tests; individuals within 95% agreement limits were within the range of 94.8–100.0%. The SVM classification accuracy, using FOP and FOR variables from the left hemispace, ranged from 83.3 to 100.0% in a binary classification (HSN vs non-HSN). The FOPR test demonstrated differences in SR and RT for both FOP and FOR across the groups. Conclusion The FOPR test was valid for the HSN diagnosis and provided quantitative and intuitive information regarding visuospatial function. Furthermore, it might enhance our understanding of visuospatial function including HSN by applying the time relative component and concepts of perception and exploration, FOP and FOR. Trial registration: NCT03463122. Registered 13 March 2018, retrospectively registered.},

abstract={The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of a tactile attention distraction from pain and compare its effectiveness with a virtual reality (VR) distraction on an analogous task. VR is considered to be the gold standard for attention distraction, but it cannot be used in certain clinical cases or for particular medical procedures. A repeatedmeasures experimental study was carried out with 42 participants using tactile and VR variants of an n-back task and a cold pressor test for pain. The independent variable was the distraction type (tactile, VR, or no-distraction) and the dependent variable was pain tolerance (i.e., time participants kept their hand in cold water). The results showed that both tactile and VR games effectively increased pain tolerance compared to the control condition. Effect sizes for both interventions were similar. However, the effect was observed only for female participants.},

abstract={Breathing exercises with biofeedback have benefits over breathing exercises without biofeedback. However, the traditional measurement of respiratory signals that is required as part of feeding back the breath incurs high cost and effort. We propose a novel virtual reality (VR) based approach to respiratory biofeedback that utilizes the positionally tracked hand controllers integrated into modern VR systems to capture and feedback the respiration-induced abdominal movements. In a randomized controlled laboratory study, we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of the developed biofeedback algorithm. In total, 72 participants performed a short breathing exercise in VR with or without respiratory biofeedback. The feedback integration resulted in a satisfactory user experience, a heightened breath awareness, a greater focus on slow diaphragmatic breathing and an increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This evidences that the novel biofeedback approach is low-cost, unobtrusive, usable and effective in increasing breath awareness and promoting slow diaphragmatic breathing in the context of VR-based breathing exercises. Future studies need to investigate the broader applicability and long-term effects.},

abstract={Previous research indicates that the size of the own body affects the judgment of objects’ size, depending on the amount of subjective ownership toward the body (Van der Hoort et al. in PLOS ONE 6(5):e20195, 2011). We are the first to transfer this own-body-size effect into a virtual environment. In a series of three experiments, participants (N = 68) had to embody small, medium, and large avatars and judge the size of objects. Body ownership was manipulated using synchronous and asynchronous touch. We also included a new paradigm with an additional change of perspective to induce stronger ownership (Experiment 2). Additionally, we assessed whether the visibility of the body during the judgment phase influenced the results (Experiment 3). In all three experiments, we found an overestimation in a small and an underestimation in a large body compared to a medium body. However, size estimation did not depend on the degree of ownership despite clear differences in self-reported ownership. Our results show that a virtual reality scenario does not require a visuotactile manipulation of ownership in order to evoke the own-body-size effect. Our validation of the effect in a virtual setting may be helpful for the design of clinical applications.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was (1) to implement a test for binocular imbalance in a Virtual Reality headset, (2) to assess its testability, reliability and outcomes in a population of clinical patients and (3) to evaluate the relationships of interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and binocular imbalance to amblyogenic risk factors. 100 volunteers (6 to 70 years old, mean 21.2 ± 16.2), 21 with no amblyogenic risk factors and 79 with amblyopia or a history of amblyopia participated. Participants were classified by amblyogenic risk factor (24 anisometropic, 25 strabismic and 30 mixed) and, for those with strabismus, also by refractive response (16 accommodative and 39 non-accommodative). We characterized our sample using three variables, called the ‘triplet’ henceforth: interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and imbalance factor. Binocular imbalance showed high test-retest reliability (no significant difference between test and retest in a subgroup, n = 20, p = 0.831); was correlated with Worth 4 dots test (r = 0.538, p<0.0001); and correlated with both interocular acuity difference (r = 0.575, p<0.0001) and stereoacuity (r = 0.675, p<0.0001). The mean values of each variable of the triplet differed depending on group classification. Mixed and non-accommodative groups showed the worst mean values compared with the other groups. Among participants with strabismus, strabismic vs mixed subgroups did not show significant differences in any variable of the triplet, whereas the accommodative vs non-accommodative subgroups showed significant differences in all of them. According to a univariate logistic model, any variable of the triplet provides a good metric for differentiating patients from controls, except for binocular imbalance for anisometropic subgroup. The proposed binocular imbalance test is feasible and reliable. We recommend monitoring amblyopia clinically not only considering visual acuity, but also stereoacuity and interocular imbalance. Stereoacuity on its own fails because of the high percentage of patients with no measurable stereoacuity. Binocular imbalance may help to fill that gap.},

abstract={The English version of the Independent Television Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI), which was developed in 2001 to measure how involved or present participants are when experiencing different media, has substantial psychometric evidence. This study was used to translate and validate the ITC-SOPI in interactive virtual environments among the Chinese population. We used the forward-backward translation procedure. An expert panel reviewed the translated ITC-SOPI until the Chinese version of the ITC-SOPI was finalized. A total of 210 participants (133 males and 77 females), with a mean age of 23.05 years (SD = 3.56, range = 17–47), completed the Chinese ITC-SOPI. The following psychometric properties were examined: factor structure, internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed a good fit (χ2/df = 1.70, Tucker–Lewis Index TLI] = 0.91, comparative fit index CFI] = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation RMSEA] = 0.058) of the four-factor model (spatial presence, engagement, ecological validity, and negative effects). For each factor, the Chinese ITC-SOPI had high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.75 to 0.87) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.82 to 0.91). Significant correlations were identified between all factors and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index-C (IRI-C) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The Chinese ITC-SOPI had good psychometric properties, suggesting that it is a reliable and valid tool for evaluating media users’ sense of presence in a Chinese-speaking context.},

abstract={Today, falls constitute a substantial health problem, especially in the elderly, and the diagnostic tests used by clinicians present often a low sensitivity and specificity. This is the case for the Timed Up and Go test which lacks contextualization with regard to everyday life limiting the relevance of its diagnosis. Virtual reality enables the creation of immersive, reproducible and secure environments, close to situations encountered in daily life, and as such could improve falling risk assessment. This study aims to evaluate the effect of immersive virtual reality by wearing a virtual reality headset with a non-disturbing virtual environment compared to real world on the Timed Up and Go test completion. Thirty-one elders (73.7 ± 9 years old) volunteered to participate in the study and the mean times and number of steps to complete a Timed Up and Go were compared in two conditions: actual-world clinical and virtual reality conditions. The results showed that the mean completion times and most of the mean number of steps of the Timed Up and Go in virtual reality condition were significantly different to those in clinical condition. These results suggest that there is a virtual reality effect and this effect is significantly correlated to the time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go. This information will be of interest to quantify the potential part of virtual reality effect on the motor control, measured in a virtual task using virtual controlled disturbances.},

abstract={Background: Recently, training in arthroscopy was improved with the integration of virtual reality (VR) simulators which enable semi-autonomous learning for novices. The NOVICE cohort confirmed that residents had better basic triangulation skills when they followed a regular 6-month VR simulator program, instead of occasional workshop-type training. We attempted to discover whether the skills of novices recorded for the NOVICE cohort were different from those of residents at the end of the degree course (CONFIRMED) or those of expert practitioners (EXPERTS), according to the type of training. Methods: 2 new cohorts were formed: French residents at the end of training (CONFIRMED), and international shoulder experts (EXPERTS). They all performed “Periscoping” and “Catch the stars Glenohumeral” exercises in a single session with 3 trials, and completed the same questionnaire. Their results were compared to those of the NOVICE cohort with 6 trials after 6 months without specific training (NOVICE A), with occasional training (NOVICE B) or with regular training on a VR simulator for 6 months (NOVICE C). The variables of Time, Camera Alignment, Camera Movement and Clamp Movement were analyzed. Results: For the Periscoping exercise, there was a significant difference in Time (EXPERTS: 138s, CONFIRMED: 110s, NOVICE A: 149s (p > 0.0001) and NOVICE C: 129s (p=0.00976)), Camera Alignment (EXPERTS: 81%, CONFIRMED: 87%, NOVICE A: 92% (p > 0.00141)), and Camera Movement (EXPERTS: 123cm, CONFIRMED: 101cm, NOVICE A: 126cm, NOVICE B: 114cm, NOVICE C: 115cm (p > 0.0001)). For the Catch the stars exercise, there was a significant difference in Time, (EXPERTS: 81s, CONFIRMED: 143s, NOVICE A: 121s, NOVICE B: 105s, NOVICE C: 112s (p > 0.0001)), Camera Movement (EXPERTS 41cm, CONFIRMED 63cm, NOVICE A 52cm, NOVICE B 45cm, NOVICE C 51cm (p > 0.0001)) and Clamp Movement (EXPERTS 116cm, CONFIRMED 204cm, NOVICE A 155cm, NOVICE B 146cm, NOVICE C 157cm (p > 0.0001)). Conclusion: The ‘Catch the stars’ exercise seemed to be an exercise that distinguishes the different levels of expertise, and was closer to the daily practice of arthroscopy. The Periscoping exercise was designed to teach the basics of triangulation, and novices who had many trials were likely to perform better than experts after three trials.},

abstract={The purpose of this experimental study is to validate linear and angular measurements acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment via a comparison with the physical measurements. The hypotheses tested are as follows: VR linear and angular measurements (1) are equivalent to the corresponding physical measurements and (2) achieve a high degree of reproducibility. Both virtual and physical measurements were performed by two raters in four different sessions. A total of 40 linear and 15 angular measurements were acquired from three physical objects (an L-block, a hand model, and a dry skull) via the use of fiducial markers on selected locations. After both intra- and inter-rater reliability were evaluated using inter-class coefficient (ICC), equivalence between virtual and physical measurements was analyzed via paired t test and Bland-Altman plots. The accuracy of the virtual measurements was further estimated using two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure. The reproducibility of virtual measurements was evaluated via ICC as well as the repeatability coefficient. Virtual reality measurements were equivalent to physical measurements as evidenced by a paired t test with p values of 0.413 for linear and 0.533 for angular measurements and Bland-Altman plots in all three objects. The accuracy of virtual measurements was estimated to be 0.5 mm for linear and 0.7° for angular measurements, respectively. Reproducibility in VR measurements was high as evidenced by ICC of 1.00 for linear and 0.99 for angular measurements, respectively. Both linear and angular measurements in the VR environment are equivalent to the physical measurements with high accuracy and reproducibility.},

abstract={This manuscript analyzes the influence of display parameters and display devices over the spatial skills of the users in virtual reality environments. For this, the authors of this manuscript developed a virtual reality application which tests the spatial skills of the users. 240 students used an LG desktop display and 61 students used the Gear VR for the tests. Statistical data are generated when the users do the tests and the following factors are logged by the application and evaluated in this manuscript: virtual camera type, virtual camera field of view, virtual camera rotation, contrast ratio parameters, the existence of shadows and the device used. The probabilities of correct answers were analyzed based on these factors by logistic regression (logit) analysis method. The influences and interactions of all factors were analyzed. The perspective camera, lighter contrast ratio, no or large camera rotations and the use of the Gear VR greatly and positively influenced the probability of correct answers on the tests. Therefore, for the assessment of spatial ability in virtual reality, the use of these parameters and device present the optimal user-centric human–computer interaction practice.},

abstract={Objective: The aims of the present study were twofold: 1) to examine the effects of a virtual reality version of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR) using a placebo as the control condition; 2) to delineate sex differences in psychophysiological responses following the TSST-VR. Methods: Healthy young male (n = 30) and female (n = 30) undergraduates were randomly assigned to a psychosocial stress protocol condition or to a non-stressful control condition (placebo) also under virtual reality environment (VR). Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured throughout the condition. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the perceived stress before and after the condition. We also included subjective scales of emotional states and coping. Results: Different ANOVAs showed that after VR, the stress group reported higher scores on VAS than the non-stress group. Before VR, compared with females, the males showed stronger EDA and higher HRV. Under VR, the males had lower HR. After VR, the males’ HR was still lower than females’, but their HRV was higher than females’. Finally, the correlation between subjective and objective reactivity demonstrated that HRV during the experiment was negatively correlated to depression and negative affect. The HRV after VR was negatively correlated to the positive coping but was positively correlated to the depression. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the TSST-VR could be used as an available tool for testing sex differences to psychosocial stress induction in experimental settings. Compared with females, males were more sensitive to stress. The scores on depression, negative affect and positive coping before the stress induction may be able to predict the arousal of the sympathetic nervous system across the stress situations.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether distraction (lack of attentional focus) and attention (cognitive load) are differentially involved in the analgesic effect of virtual reality (VR) immersions during a cold pressor test (CPT). Methods: Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (high and low cognitive load, attention with or without a reminder of the pain stimuli) and performed three CPTs. Pain was assessed based on the duration of the CPT (pain tolerance), a visual analog rating scale of perceived pain intensity during the CPT and the subjective pain scale of the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Results: The statistical analyses revealed that VR immersions were associated with less pain compared to the baseline (all p < 0.001), but for the experimental manipulations, only the conditions where there was an increase in cognitive load (ie, from low cognitive load at Immersion 1 to high cognitive load at Immersion 2) were effective for increasing pain tolerance (significant Time X Conditions interaction). The interactions were not significant for pain intensity assessed with the VAS or the SF-MPQ. Conclusion: The results suggest that increases in cognitive load play an important role in the analgesic effect of VR immersion, although the combination of attentional focus and cognitive load may be important. Suggestions are given for designing a replication study.},

abstract={Clinical science and medical imaging technology are traditionally displayed in two dimensions (2D) on a computer monitor. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) expands the realm of 2D image visualization, enabling an immersive VR experience with unhindered spatial interaction by the user. Thus far, analysis of data extracted from VR applications was mainly qualitative. In this study, we enhance VR and provide evidence for quantitative VR research by validating digital VR display of computed tomography (CT) data of the orbit. Volumetric CT data were transferred and rendered into a VR environment. Subsequently, seven graders performed repeated and blinded diameter measurements. The intergrader variability of the measurements in VR was much lower compared to measurements in the physical world and measurements were reasonably consistent with their corresponding elements in the real context. The overall VR measurements were 5.49% higher. As such, this study attests the ability of VR to provide similar quantitative data alongside the added benefit of VR interfaces. VR entails a lot of potential for the future research in ophthalmology and beyond in any scientific field that uses three-dimensional data.},

abstract={Microwave remote sensing is the most promising tool for monitoring near-surface soil moisture distributions globally. With the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions in orbit, considerable efforts are being made to evaluate derived soil moisture products via ground observations, microwave transfer simulation, and independent remote sensing retrievals. Due to the large footprint of the satellite radiometers of about 40 km in diameter and the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture, minimum sampling densities for soil moisture are required to challenge the targeted precision. Here we use 400 m resolution simulations with the regional Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) and its coupling with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM) to quantify the maximum sampling distance allowed for soil moisture and brightness temperature validation. Our analysis suggests that an overall sampling distance of finer than 6 km is required to validate the targeted accuracy of 0.04 cm3 cm-3 with a 70 % confidence level in SMOS and SMAP estimates over typical mid-latitude European regions. The maximum allowed sampling distance depends on the land-surface heterogeneity and the meteorological situation, which influences the soil moisture patterns, and ranges from about 6 to 17 km for a 70 % confidence level for a typical year. At the maximum allowed sampling distance on a 70 % confidence level, the accuracy of footprint-averaged soil moisture is equal to or better than brightness temperature estimates over the same area. Estimates strongly deteriorate with larger sampling distances. For the evaluation of the smaller footprints of the active and active–passive products of SMAP the required sampling densities increase; e.g., when a grid resolution of 3 km diameter is sampled by three sites of footprints of 9 km sampled by five sites required, only 50 %–60 % of the pixels have a sampling error below the nominal values. The required minimum sampling densities for ground-based radiometer networks to estimate footprint-averaged brightness temperature are higher than for soil moisture due to the non-linearities of radiative transfer, and only weakly correlated in space and time. This study provides a basis for a better understanding of the sometimes strong mismatches between derived satellite soil moisture products and ground-based measurements.},

abstract={Paranoia may build on negative beliefs held both about the self and others. Compassionate imagery may be one way of reducing such negative beliefs, and hence paranoia. Two studies tested this idea, one targeting compassion for the self and one targeting compassion for others. Two-hundred individuals from the general population scoring highly for paranoia were recruited. The studies used a randomised controlled experimental design, with embedded tests for mediation. Study one targeted self-compassion via creation of a compassionate coach (CC) image. Study two targeted compassion for others via loving kindness meditation (LKM). Individuals repeatedly entered neutral virtual reality social environments. Changes in compassion and paranoia were assessed. Compared to controls, the CC group increased in self-compassion (group difference = 2.12, C.I. = 1.57;2.67, p = <0.0001, d = 1.4) and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.73, C.I. = −2.48; −0.98, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in self-compassion explained 57% of change in paranoia. Compared to controls, the LKM group increased their compassion for others (group difference = 3.26, C.I. = 2.72;3.80, p = <0.0001, d = 1.7), and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.70, C.I. = −2.50; −0.89, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in compassion for others explained 67% of change in paranoia. Targeting negative beliefs about the self and others using compassionate imagery causes reductions in paranoia.

abstract={The Diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) requires an exhaustive and objective assessment in order to design an intervention that is adapted to the peculiarities of the patients. The present study aimed to determine if the most commonly used ADHD observation scale—the Evaluation of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity (EDAH) scale—is able to predict performance in a Continuous Performance Test based on Virtual Reality (VR-CPT). One-hundred-and-fifty students (76% boys and 24% girls) aged 6–16 (M = 10.35; DT = 2.39) participated in the study. Regression analyses showed that only the EDAH subscale referring to inattention symptoms, was a statistically significant predictor of performance in a VR-CPT. More specifically, this subscale showed 86.5% prediction-accuracy regarding performance in the Omissions variable, 80.4% in the Commissions variable, and 74.5% in the Response-time variable. The EDAH subscales referring to impulsivity and hyperactivity were not statistically significant predictors of any variables in the VR-CPT. Our findings may partially explain why impulsive-hyperactive and the combined presentations of ADHD might be considered as unique and qualitatively different sub-categories of ADHD. These results also highlighted the importance of measuring not only the observable behaviors of ADHD individuals, but also the scores in performance tests that are attained by the patients themselves.},

abstract={Computerized continuous performance tests (CPTs) are commonly used to characterize attention in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Virtual classroom CPTs, designed to enhance ecological validity, are increasingly being utilized. Lacking is a quantitative meta-analysis of clinical comparisons of attention performance in children with ADHD using virtual classroom CPTs. The objective of the present systematic PRISMA review was to address this empirical void and compare three-dimensional (3D) virtual classroom CPTs to traditional two-dimensional (2D) CPTs. The peer-reviewed literature on comparisons of virtual classroom performance between children with ADHD and typically developing children was explored in six databases (e.g., Medline). Published studies using a virtual classroom to compare attentional performance between children with ADHD and typically developing children were included. Given the high heterogeneity with modality comparisons (i.e., computerized CPTs vs. virtual classroom CPTs for ADHD), both main comparisons included only population comparisons (i.e., control vs. ADHD) using each CPT modality. Meta-analytic findings were generally consistent with previous meta-analyses of computerized CPTs regarding the commonly used omission, commission, and hit reaction time variables. Results suggest that the virtual classroom CPTs reliably differentiate attention performance in persons with ADHD. Ecological validity implications are discussed pertaining to subtle meta-analytic outcome differences compared to computerized 2D CPTs. Further, due to an inability to conduct moderator analyses, it remains unclear if modality differences are due to other factors. Suggestions for future research using the virtual classroom CPTs are provided.},

abstract={Negative thoughts are experienced by as many as 80–99% of the population. These thoughts are associated with a variety of negative consequences, including negative mood, decreased task performance and the development of psychopathology. One technique employed in contextual behavioral therapies to help cope with negative thoughts is cognitive defusion. Cognitive defusion techniques undermine potential negative effects of thinking by teaching clients to get some distance from their thoughts. Virtual reality (VR) is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that users can interact in. VR is of increasing interest to applied psychologists due to its potential for exposure learning. One area where VR may be effective is helping people to cope with negative thoughts. The current study examined the impact of a VR task as a cognitive defusion technique on participants’ relationship with a negative self-referential thought (e.g., “I am a failure”). Thirty participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (i.e., defusion VR and control VR). Participants were tested pre- and post-VR task on a state measure of cognitive defusion and ratings of their self-referential negative thought. The results indicated that a defusion VR task facilitates the management of negative thoughts and leads to an increase in state defusion. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the use of VR techniques in dealing with negative thoughts.},

abstract={With the development of autonomous driving technology, it is possible self-driving cleaning truck being driving and working automatically. However, a lot of field trials are timeconsuming and wasteful during the investigation of self-driving truck. In order to reduce lots of on-site and real vehicle tests, we construct a 3D virtual pilotless vehicle testing system for the cleaning truck based on virtual reality technology. 3DMax software is used to build virtual 3D scene static model and cleaning truck model. The established static models are imported into Unity3D to simulate different 3D scenes during cleaning truck self-driving. We designed a UI interface to build a virtual testing system of self-driving cleaning truck which is easy to realize human-computer interaction. we have achieved successfully the avoidance of obstacles and round-the-island driving. And we have successfully completed the identification of traffic lights and the pilotless driving test on crossroad virtual scene. In the virtual testing system, we can quickly experience the virtual testing scenes of the self-driving cleaning truck in various scenarios and get some kinematics information. The virtual testing system can partly replace the field tests and provide methods and theoretical guidance for field test, which can shorten the development cycle and save money, and is also unrestricted and repeatable. At the same time, the researching results provide new ideas and methods for the investigation of vehicle tests and pilotless driving.},

abstract={Despite the persistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) into adulthood and adolescence, there are few objective, reliable instruments (based on patient performance) that have been shown to be able to predict current and retrospective ADHD symptoms. The present study aimed to explore whether a validated VR test called Nesplora Aquarium is able to predict ADHD symptoms in adults and adolescents, based on both current and retrospective self-reports. A non-clinical sample of 156 adults and adolescents (70 women and 86 men) between 16 and 54 years of age (M = 21.23, SD = 8.04) took part in the study. Virtual reality (VR) variables such as the number of correct answers, omission and commission errors, among others, were used to predict current and retrospective self-reported symptoms of ADHD using multiple regression models. Correct answers and omission errors in the VR test significantly predicted both current and retrospective ADHD symptoms. However, only the number of perseveration errors and gender were able to significantly predict retrospective ADHD symptoms. These findings suggest that inattention problems tend to remain after adolescence, while perseveration errors (which have been related to impulsive behavior) and gender differences tend to diminish.},

abstract={Background: Compensatory movement, such as flexing the trunk during reaching, may negatively affect motor improvement during task-based practice for persons with stroke. Shaping, or incrementally decreasing, the amount of compensation used during rehabilitation may be a viable strategy with methods using virtual reality.Methods: A virtual reality tool was designed to (1) monitor upper extremity movement kinematics with an off-the-shelf motion sensor (Microsoft Kinect V2), (2) convert movements into control of widely available computer games, and (3) provide real-time feedback to shape trunk compensation. This system was tested for feasibility by a small cohort of participants with chronic stroke (n = 5) during a 1-h session involving 40 min of virtual reality interaction. Outcomes related to repetitions, compensation, movement kinematics, usability, motivation, and sense of presence were collected.Results: Participants achieved a very high dose of reaching repetitions (461 ± 184), with an average of 81% being successful and 19% involving compensatory trunk flexion. Participants rated the system as highly usable, motivating, engaging, and safe.Conclusions: VRShape is feasible to use as a tool for increasing repetition rates, measuring and shaping compensation, and enhancing motivation for upper extremity therapy. Future research should focus on software improvements and investigation of efficacy during a virtual reality-based motor intervention.},

abstract={Background/Objective: Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) have demonstrated validity when differentiating children with ADHD from healthy controls. However, these CPTs have limitations such as low ecological validity. New CPTs based on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) have appeared as supposedly improved methods for assessing ADHD. This study aims to compare the discriminant value of attentional variables produced by a VR CPT (Aula Nesplora) with that of variables from a traditional CPT (Test of Variables of Attention; TOVA) for identifying ADHD. Method: A total of 338 children aged between 6 and 16 years old (M = 10.84, SD = 3.01) participated in the study: 31.95% correspond to the inattentive presentation, 15.38% to the impulsive-hyperactive presentation, 22.78% to the combined presentation, and the remaining 29.88% correspond to children without ADHD. Results: Results indicated that Aula Nesplora predicts ADHD presentations better than TOVA. It also differentiates better between ADHD and non-ADHD students. Conclusions: These findings show the potential advantages of using virtual reality in ADHD assessment, as it facilitates the diagnosis of ADHD and the differentiation of its presentations in a realistic environment.Alternate abstract:Antecedentes/objetivos: Los tests de ejecución continua (Continuous Perfomance Test; CPT) han mostrado utilidad en la diferenciación de los ninos con TDAH de los controles.

abstract={BackgroundGait retraining interventions using real-time biofeedback have been proposed to alter the loading across the knee joint in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Despite the demonstrated benefits of these conservative treatments, their clinical adoption is currently obstructed by the high complexity, spatial demands, and cost of optical motion capture systems. In this study we propose and evaluate a wearable visual feedback system for gait retraining of the foot progression angle (FPA).MethodsThe primary components of the system are inertial measurement units, which track the human movement without spatial limitations, and an augmented reality headset used to project the visual feedback in the visual field. The adapted gait protocol contained five different target angles ranging from 15 degrees toe-out to 5 degrees toe-in. Eleven healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill, and the protocol was performed using both an established laboratory visual feedback driven by optical motion capture, and the proposed wearable system.Results and conclusionsThe wearable system tracked FPA with an accuracy of 2.4 degrees RMS and ICC=0.94 across all target angles and subjects, when compared to an optical motion capture reference. In addition, the effectiveness of the biofeedback, reflected by the number of steps with FPA value ±2 degrees from the target, was found to be around 50% in both wearable and laboratory approaches. These findings demonstrate that retraining of the FPA using wearable inertial sensing and visual feedback is feasible with effectiveness matching closely an established laboratory method. The proposed wearable setup may reduce the complexity of gait retraining applications and facilitate their transfer to routine clinical practice.},

abstract={IntroductionDissociated tests of strabismus provide valuable information for diagnosis and monitoring of ocular misalignment in patients with normal retinal correspondence. However, they are vulnerable to operator error and rely on a fixed head position. Virtual reality headsets obviate the need for head fixation, while providing other clear theoretical advantages, including complete control over the illumination and targets presented for the patient's interaction.PurposeWe compared the performance of a virtual reality-based test of ocular misalignment to that of the traditional Lees screen, to establish the feasibility of using virtual reality technology in ophthalmic settings in the future.MethodsThree patients underwent a traditional Lees screen test, and a virtual reality headset-based test of ocular motility. The virtual reality headset-based programme consisted of an initial test to measure horizontal and vertical deviation, followed by a test for torsion.ResultsThe pattern of deviation obtained using the virtual reality-based test showed agreement with that obtained from the Lees screen for patients with a fourth nerve palsy, comitant esotropia, and restrictive thyroid eye disease.ConclusionsThis study reports the first use of a virtual reality headset in assessing ocular misalignment, and demonstrates that it is a feasible dissociative test of strabismus.},

abstract={Purpose To assess the construct and face validity of ArthroS, a passive haptic VR simulator. A secondary aim was to evaluate the novel performance metrics produced by this simulator. Methods Two groups of 30 participants, each divided into novice, intermediate or expert based on arthroscopic experience, completed three separate tasks on either the knee or shoulder module of the simulator. Performance was recorded using 12 automatically generated performance metrics and video footage of the arthroscopic procedures. The videos were blindly assessed using a validated global rating scale (GRS). Participants completed a survey about the simulator's realism and training utility. Results This new simulator demonstrated construct validity of its tasks when evaluated against a GRS (p less than or equal to] 0.003 in all cases). Regarding it's automatically generated performance metrics, established outputs such as time taken (p less than or equal to] 0.001) and instrument path length (p less than or equal to] 0.007) also demonstrated good construct validity. However, two-thirds of the proposed 'novel metrics' the simulator reports could not distinguish participants based on arthroscopic experience. Face validity assessment rated the simulator as a realistic and useful tool for trainees, but the passive haptic feedback (a key feature of this simulator) is rated as less realistic. Conclusion The ArthroS simulator has good task construct validity based on established objective outputs, but some of the novel performance metrics could not distinguish between surgical experience. The passive haptic feedback of the simulator also needs improvement. If simulators could offer automated and validated performance feedback, this would facilitate improvements in the delivery of training by allowing trainees to practise and self-assess.},

abstract={Background. Prolonged exposure to moving images in virtual reality systems can cause virtual reality induced motion sickness (VIMS). The ability to resist motion sickness may be associated with the level of vestibular function development. objective. The aim of the present research is to study the oculomotor characteristics of individuals whose observation of moving virtual environments causes the VIMS effect. We hypothesized that people who have a robust vestibular function as a result of their professional activity, are less susceptible to VIMS than people who have no such professional abilities. The differences in people’s abilities to resist the effects of the virtual environment may be revealed in the oculomotor characteristics registered during their interaction with a virtual environment. Design. Figure skaters, football players, wushu fighters, and non-trained people were tested. e CAVE virtual reality system was used to initiate the VIMS effect. three virtual scenes were constructed consisting of many bright balls moving as a whole around the observer. e scenes differed in the width of the visual field; all balls subtended either 45°, 90° or 180°. Results. The results showed more active eye movements for athletes compared to non-trained people, i.e. an increase in blink, fixation, and saccade counts. A decrease in saccadic amplitudes was revealed for figure skaters. These characteristics were considered specific indicators of the athletes’ ability to resist motion sickness. Conclusions. It was found that the strength of the VIMS effect increased with the increasing width of the visual field. The effectiveness of virtual reality and eye-tracking technologies to test the VIMS effect was demonstrated.},

abstract={IntroductionInformal caregivers for people with dementia (hereafter: caregivers) often feel (over)burdened by the care for a loved one with dementia, and this can have various deleterious effects on both caregivers and patients. Support for caregivers is urgently needed, and for this reason, a dementia simulator (Into D’mentia) was developed in which caregivers experience what it is like to have dementia. The simulator attempts to heighten caregivers’ empathy and understanding for the patient and, in turn, diminish their own caregiver burden. The current study evaluates whether the simulator is effective on a number of outcomes.Methods and analysisA longitudinal, quasi-experimental study is ongoing in the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 142 caregivers in total divided over two groups: 71 caregivers in the intervention group and 71 caregivers in the control group. All participants will complete interviews and questionnaires at four time points: at baseline, 1 week, 2.5 months and 15 months after the training. The primary outcomes include empathy, caregiver burden, caregiver’s sense of competence, social reliance, anxiety, depression and caregivers’ subjective and objective health.Ethics and disseminationThis study is being carried out in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol has been approved by the local ethics committees.Registration detailsThis study is registered with The Netherlands National Trial Register (NNTR5856).},

abstract={People mimic each other's actions and postures during everyday interactions. It is widely believed this mimicry acts as a social glue, leading to increased rapport. We present two studies using virtual reality to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Study 1, 50 participants interacted with two avatars who either mimicked their head and torso movements at a 1 or 3 second time delay or did not mimic, and rated feelings of rapport and trust toward the avatars. Rapport was higher towards mimicking avatars, with no effect of timing. In Study 2, we aimed to replicate this effect in a pre-registered design and test whether it is modulated by cultural ingroup-outgroup boundaries. Forty participants from European or East Asian backgrounds interacted with four avatars, two of European appearance and two of East Asian appearance. Two avatars mimicked while the other two did not. We found no effects of mimicry on rapport or trust ratings or implicit trust behaviour in a novel maze task, and no effects of group status or interactions. These null results were calculated in line with our pre-registration. We conclude that being mimicked does not always increase rapport or trust, and make suggestions for future directions.},

abstract={Issue Title: The protectors of the knee: Meniscus and cartilage Purpose This study was to determine face and construct validity of a new virtual reality-based shoulder arthroscopy simulator which uses passive haptic feedback. Methods Fifty-one participants including 25 novices (100 shoulder arthroscopies) completed two tests: for assessment of face validity, a questionnaire was filled out concerning quality of simulated reality and training potential using a 7-point Likert scale (range 1-7). Construct validity was tested by comparing simulator metrics (operation time in seconds, camera and grasper pathway in centimetre and grasper openings) between novices and experts test results. Results Overall simulated reality was rated high with a median value of 5.5 (range 2.8-7) points. Training capacity scored a median value of 5.8 (range 3-7) points. Experts were significantly faster in the diagnostic test with a median of 91 (range 37-208) s than novices with 1177 (range 81-383) s (p < 0.0001) and in the therapeutic test 102 (range 58-283) s versus 229 (range 114-399) s (p < 0.0001). Similar results were seen in the other metric values except in the camera pathway in the therapeutic test. Conclusion The tested simulator achieved high scores in terms of realism and training capability. It reliably discriminated between novices and experts. Further improvements of the simulator, especially in the field of therapeutic arthroscopy, might improve its value as training and assessment tool for shoulder arthroscopy skills.

abstract={Purpose Virtual reality simulator training has become important for acquiring arthroscopic skills. A new simulator for knee arthroscopy ArthroS(TM) has been developed. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate face and construct validity, executed according to a protocol used previously to validate arthroscopic simulators. Methods Twenty-seven participants were divided into three groups having different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants answered questions regarding general information and the outer appearance of the simulator for face validity. Construct validity was assessed with one standardized navigation task. Face validity, educational value and user friendliness were further determined by giving participants three exercises and by asking them to fill out the questionnaire. Results Construct validity was demonstrated between experts and beginners. Median task times were not significantly different for all repetitions between novices and intermediates, and between intermediates and experts. Median face validity was 8.3 for the outer appearance, 6.5 for the intra-articular joint and 4.7 for surgical instruments. Educational value and user friendliness were perceived as nonsatisfactory, especially because of the lack of tactile feedback. Conclusion The ArthroS(TM) demonstrated construct validity between novices and experts, but did not demonstrate full face validity. Future improvements should be mainly focused on the development of tactile feedback. It is necessary that a newly presented simulator is validated to prove it actually contributes to proficiency of skills.},

abstract={Designing a usable learning application is one of the key factors in ensuring effective learning. This article introduces modified group usability testing (MGUT) as a feasible framework for evaluating the usability of non-immersive virtual reality (VR) learning applications. Conventionally, usability testing of such learning applications often employs the one-to-one approach in which an evaluator conducts testing with several individual participants. As opposed to the one-to-one approach, the group approach involves several-to-many participants performing tasks simultaneously, with several evaluators observing and interacting with participants. This article describes the complete step-by-step procedure for conducting MGUT to uncover usability problems of a VR learning application that aims to educate its users on fire safety and prevention. It also proposes methods to analyze these usability problems. The effectiveness and efficiency of MGUT was then compared with DGUT, the original group testing technique and cooperative evaluation (CE), which is a typical one-to-one approach. Results indicate that all three techniques are able to reveal usability problems of different usability factors and show similar capability to discover the most critical and serious problems. MGUT is more effective than DGUT as it can collect additional usability problems of various factors and of different levels of severity. MGUT is as effective as CE as both techniques can identify usability problems which are more or less comparable in terms of quantity and quality. As for efficiency, MGUT and DGUT are more efficient than CE as these group testing approaches require lesser testing time, lesser effort in terms of the intensive interaction with participants although with slight more effort in the preparation of the physical setting. In addition, it is also obvious that MGUT and DGUT involve richer participation than CE. MGUT is also more feasible than DGUT as it allows some flexibility in the computer arrangement setting.},

abstract={Background We performed a pilot study using a single virtual-simulation suturing module as an objective measurement to determine functional use of the robotic system. This study will assist in designing a study for an objective, adjunctive test for use by a surgical proctor. Methods After IRB approval, subjects were recruited at a robotic renal surgery course to perform two attempts of the "Tubes" module without warm-up using the Da Vinci® Surgical Skills Simulator(TM). The overall MScore (%) from the simulator was compared among various skill levels to provide construct validity. Correlation with MScore and number of robotic cases was performed and pre-determined skill groups were tested. Nine metrics that make up the overall score were also tested via paired t test and subsequent logistic regression to determine which skills differed among experienced and novice robotic surgeons. Results We enrolled 38 subjects with experience ranging from 0- < 200 robotic cases. Median time to complete both tasks was less than 10 min. The MScore on the first attempt was correlated to the number of previous robotic cases (R2 = 0.465; p = 0.003). MScore was different between novice and more experienced robotic surgeons on the first (44.7 vs. 63.9; p = 0.005) and second attempt (56.0 vs. 69.9; p = 0.037). Conclusion A single virtual simulator exercise can provide objective information in determining proficient use of the robotic surgical system.},

abstract={Introduction: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of executive functions and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of executive functions are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups. Materials and methods: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC); 15 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the executive functions, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of executive functions. Results: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients versus the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of executive functions (neuropsychological battery). Conclusion: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of executive functions is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Validating cyber-interventions Previous investigations conducted on post-secondary adult students with learning disabilities (LD) suggest that deficits in visual-motor skills contribute to difficulties in written expression which impact academic achievement. Intervention strategies for individuals with LD include assistive computer-based technologies (ATs) to compensate for or maximize performance. However, research fails to assess the impact of ATs on performance, learning, and motivation of students with LD. Also, one of the limitations of ATs is that they cannot be used for assessment and training and there are very few methods to assess or train visual-motor skills in this population. The present study explores the usefulness of a hapto-visual virtual reality motor skills assessment (MSA) device for visual-motor functioning in adults with and without LD. This is a preliminary step of developing an intervention to improve impaired visual-motor skills in adults with LD. A sample of 22 male and female university students with and without LD had their visual-motor skills pretested using a standard paper-and-pencil Bender-Gestalt (BG) test and were compared according to their performance on the MSA tool. We hypothesized that our LD participants' performance would be significantly lower than our control participants on the VR task in terms of number of errors and speed. Results showed that participants without LD performed better and more rapidly on the VR task than participants with LD. There were no correlations between the BG and MSA performance. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the Bender-Gestalt scores, previous experience with video game, arousal, and mood. Our results suggest that a novel 3D virtual reality tool such as the MSA can potentially discriminate motor function of people with and without LD; however, the difference between both may also be due to a lack of problem-solving ability in LD.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Automated perimetry is used for the assessment of visual function in a variety of ophthalmic and neurologic diseases. We report development and clinical testing of a compact, head-mounted, and eye-tracking perimeter (VirtualEye) that provides a more comfortable test environment than the standard instrumentation. VirtualEye performs the equivalent of a full threshold 24-2 visual field in two modes: (1) manual, with patient response registered with a mouse click, and (2) visual grasp, where the eye tracker senses change in gaze direction as evidence of target acquisition. 59 patients successfully completed the test in manual mode and 40 in visual grasp mode, with 59 undergoing the standard Humphrey field analyzer (HFA) testing. Large visual field defects were reliably detected by VirtualEye. Point-by-point comparison between the results obtained with the different modalities indicates: (1) minimal systematic differences between measurements taken in visual grasp and manual modes, (2) the average standard deviation of the difference distributions of about 5 dB, and (3) a systematic shift (of 4-6 dB) to lower sensitivities for VirtualEye device, observed mostly in high dB range. The usability survey suggested patients' acceptance of the head-mounted device. The study appears to validate the concepts of a head-mounted perimeter and the visual grasp mode.},

abstract={Objective. With the increase in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery there is a concomitant rising demand for training methods. The objective was to establish face and construct validity of a novel virtual reality simulator (dV-Trainer, Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA) for the use in training of robot-assisted surgery. Methods. A comparative cohort study was performed. Participants (n=42 ) were divided into three groups according to their robotic experience. To determine construct validity, participants performed three different exercises twice. Performance parameters were measured. To determine face validity, participants filled in a questionnaire after completion of the exercises. Results. Experts outperformed novices in most of the measured parameters. The most discriminative parameters were "time to complete" and "economy of motion" (P<0.001 ). The training capacity of the simulator was rated 4.6 ± 0.5 SD on a 5-point Likert scale. The realism of the simulator in general, visual graphics, movements of instruments, interaction with objects, and the depth perception were all rated as being realistic. The simulator is considered to be a very useful training tool for residents and medical specialist starting with robotic surgery. Conclusions. Face and construct validity for the dV-Trainer could be established. The virtual reality simulator is a useful tool for training robotic surgery.},

This paper presents a methodology for the development of SFCSs that is based on virtual reality (VR) in order to assist the system designer at each stage of development. Exploiting VR helps the user to collect valid information quickly and in a correct form by putting the user and the information support elements in direct relation with the operation of the system in a more realistic environment. A VR-SFCS prototype tool is designed as a software system to realize the features outlined in each phase of the methodology. A set of rules and a knowledge base is appended to the methodology to remove any inconsistency that could arise between the material and the information flows during the development. A novel environment for matching the physical and the informational model domains is recommended in order to delineate the system requirements specification. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Abstract Background: Several neurorehabilitation strategies have been introduced over the last decade based on the so-called simulation hypothesis. This hypothesis states that a neural network located in primary and secondary motor areas is activated not only during overt motor execution, but also during observation or imagery of the same motor action. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the combination of a virtual reality (VR) based neurorehabilitation system together with a wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrument. This combination is particularly appealing from a rehabilitation perspective as it may allow minimally constrained monitoring during neurorehabilitative training. Methods: fNIRS was applied over F3 of healthy subjects during task performance in a virtual reality (VR) environment: 1) 'unilateral' group (N = 15), contralateral recording during observation , motor imagery , observation & motor imagery , and imitation of a grasping task performed by a virtual limb (first-person perspective view) using the right hand; 2) 'bilateral' group (N = 8), bilateral recording during observation and imitation of the same task using the right and left hand alternately. Results: In the unilateral group, significant within-condition oxy-hemoglobin concentration ΔO2 Hb] changes (mean ± SD μmol/l) were found for motor imagery (0.0868 ± 0.5201 μmol/l) and imitation (0.1715 ± 0.4567 μmol/l). In addition, the bilateral group showed a significant within-condition ΔO2 Hb] change for observation (0.0924 ± 0.3369 μmol/l) as well as between-conditions with lower ΔO2 Hb] amplitudes during observation compared to imitation , especially in the ipsilateral hemisphere (p < 0.001). Further, in the bilateral group, imitation using the non-dominant (left) hand resulted in larger ΔO2 Hb] changes in both the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres as compared to using the dominant (right) hand. Conclusions: This study shows that our combined VR-fNIRS based neurorehabilitation system can activate the action-observation system as described by the simulation hypothesis during performance of observation, motor imagery and imitation of hand actions elicited by a VR environment. Further, in accordance with previous studies, the findings of this study revealed that both inter-subject variability and handedness need to be taken into account when recording in untrained subjects. These findings are of relevance for demonstrating the potential of the VR-fNIRS instrument in neurofeedback applications.},

abstract={Abstract Background: Stroke is a frequent cause of adult disability that can lead to enduring impairments. However, given the life-long plasticity of the brain one could assume that recovery could be facilitated by the harnessing of mechanisms underlying neuronal reorganization. Currently it is not clear how this reorganization can be mobilized. Novel technology based neurorehabilitation techniques hold promise to address this issue. Here we describe a Virtual Reality (VR) based system, the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) that is based on a number of hypotheses on the neuronal mechanisms underlying recovery, the structure of training and the role of individualization. We investigate the psychometrics of the RGS in stroke patients and healthy controls. Methods: We describe the key components of the RGS and the psychometrics of one rehabilitation scenario called Spheroids. We performed trials with 21 acute/subacute stroke patients and 20 healthy controls to study the effect of the training parameters on task performance. This allowed us to develop a Personalized Training Module (PTM) for online adjustment of task difficulty. In addition, we studied task transfer between physical and virtual environments. Finally, we assessed the usability and acceptance of the RGS as a rehabilitation tool. Results: We show that the PTM implemented in RGS allows us to effectively adjust the difficulty and the parameters of the task to the user by capturing specific features of the movements of the arms. The results reported here also show a consistent transfer of movement kinematics between physical and virtual tasks. Moreover, our usability assessment shows that the RGS is highly accepted by stroke patients as a rehabilitation tool. Conclusions: We introduce a novel VR based paradigm for neurorehabilitation, RGS, which combines specific rehabilitative principles with a psychometric evaluation to provide a personalized and automated training. Our results show that the RGS effectively adjusts to the individual features of the user, allowing for an unsupervised deployment of individualized rehabilitation protocols.},

abstract={The study was carried out to analyze the learning rate for laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality training system and to establish whether the simulator was able to differentiate between surgeons with different laparoscopic experience. Forty-one surgeons were divided into three groups according to their experience in laparoscopic surgery: masters (group 1, performed more than 100 cholecystectomies), intermediates (group 2, between 15 and 80 cholecystectomies), and beginners (group 3, fewer than 10 cholecystectomies) were included in the study. The participants were tested on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) 10 consecutive times within a 1-month period. Assessment of laparoscopic skills included time, errors, and economy of hand movement, measured by the simulator. The learning curves regarding time reached plateau after the second repetition for group 1, the fifth repetition for group 2, and the seventh repetition for group 3 (Friedman's tests P 0.2) indicating the absence of a learning curve for these parameters. Group 2 error scores reached plateau after the first repetition, and group 3 after the fifth repetition. Group 2 improved their economy of movement score up to the third repetition and group 3 up to the sixth repetition (Friedman's tests, P <0.05). Experienced surgeons (group 1) demonstrated best performance parameters, followed by group 2 and group 3 (Mann-Whitney test P <0.05). Different learning curves existed for surgeons with different laparoscopic background. The familiarization rate on the simulator was proportional to the operative experience of the surgeons. Experienced surgeons demonstrated best laparoscopic performance on the simulator, followed by those with intermediate experience and the beginners. These differences indicate that the scoring system of MIST-VR is sensitive and specific to measuring skills relevant for laparoscopic surgery.},
